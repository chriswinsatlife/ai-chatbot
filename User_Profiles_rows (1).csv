## 7. Cost Considerations & Price Ranges

*   **Price Sensitivity:** The client appears to be cost-conscious, often opting for budget carriers (IndiGo, SpiceJet) and utilizing points/card combinations where possible.
*   **Typical Price Ranges (INR for domestic, USD for US domestic, INR for international from India):**
    *   DEL-AMD / AMD-DEL (one-way, per person): ~INR 1800 - INR 4600.
    *   SJC-LAX (one-way, per person): USD 313.20 (for a group of 4, so per person is ~$78.30).
    *   LAX-SJC (one-way, per person): USD 215.92 (for a group of 4, so per person is ~$53.98).
    *   AMD-BOM (one-way, per person, with Shweta Pardeshi): ~INR 2829.
    *   DEL-BOM (one-way, per person): INR 4254.
    *   International (e.g., DEL-LAX via DOH): ~INR 54,734.
    *   International (e.g., AMD-BKK): ~INR 17,419 per person (34838 for 2).
*   **Balancing Cost vs. Convenience:** Seems to favor cost-effectiveness, especially for domestic travel. Direct flights are taken when reasonably priced.

## 8. Ancillary Services & Loyalty

*   **In-flight Wi-Fi:** No explicit mention or preference.
*   **Meal Requests:** No specific meal requests noted in the provided data.
*   **Baggage:**
    *   Standard checked baggage allowance (e.g., 15 KG for domestic Indian flights) is generally sufficient.
    *   One record (NJIR2Z on Spirit) shows ""CARRYON00"" and ""CHECKED 00"", which might indicate a no-baggage fare or a need to purchase separately. Clarify if baggage is needed for budget airline bookings.
*   **Frequent Flyer Programs:**
    *   **Shweta Pardeshi:** Free Spirit - 1026014699. Ensure this is added to Spirit Airlines bookings for her.
    *   **Kanishk Kalra:** No specific frequent flyer numbers are consistently listed, though travel on Star Alliance (Air India, Vistara) and oneworld (Qatar Airways) has occurred. It's advisable to ask Kanishk if he has preferred programs for these or other airlines/alliances.

## 9. Critical Mandates & Restrictions

*   **Client Name:** Ensure ""Kanishk Kalra"" is spelled correctly for all bookings.
*   **Companions:** Shweta Pardeshi frequently travels with Kanishk Kalra. Aman Ahuja and Keerthi Ravindran have also traveled in a group with them.
*   **Contact Information:** Use `kanishkkalra1999@gmail.com` and `13017097928` for Kanishk Kalra's bookings where required.
*   **Booking Confirmation:** Always ensure flights are ""Confirmed"" or ""Ticketed."" Monitor ""On-hold"" bookings (e.g., W2SO6L with Qatar Airways) to ensure they are ticketed before expiry.
*   **Changes/Cancellations:** Be aware that changes and cancellations have occurred (e.g., Spirit Airlines flight change, Paytm cancellation). Understand the fare rules before booking.

## 10. Other Actionable Insights

*   **Multiple Bookings for Same Trip:** Pay attention to reservation IDs (e.g., PNR) to avoid duplicate entries when logging travel or interpreting booking emails. Some trips involve multiple emails for the same PNR (confirmations, check-ins, changes).
*   **Booking Lead Time:** Varies significantly. Some flights are booked months in advance (e.g., DEL-LAX booked in July for September), while others are booked closer to the travel date (e.g., AMD-DEL booked a week prior).
*   **Travel Purpose:** Not explicitly stated, but the variety of destinations (domestic, international, leisure-sounding like Goa and Dazzling Dubai tour) suggests a mix of business and personal travel. This might influence flexibility or budget for future bookings.
*   **Check-in Preferences:** Web check-in is mentioned as mandatory for some airlines (e.g., SpiceJet). Client has used web check-in (e.g., Vistara UK 976).
*   **Terminal Information:** Often included in confirmations; ensure this is communicated to the client.
*   **Group Travel:** Kanishk sometimes travels with others (Shweta Pardeshi, Aman Ahuja, Keerthi Ravindran, Jitender Kalra, Chanchal Kalra, M Mohit Mina, Raghava Mahanthi, Utsav Jethva, Darshit Kalathiya). Coordinate bookings if they are traveling together and prefer to be on the same flights/itineraries.
*   **Currency:** Note the currency of the booking (INR or USD observed) for expense reporting.
*   **Third-Party Bookers:** Several bookings are made via OTAs like Cleartrip, Goibibo, EaseMyTrip, Yatra, and ixigo. This suggests a preference for comparing prices or utilizing deals/points from these platforms.
*   **MasterCard 0556:** This card is frequently used for bookings made by Kanishk Kalra.","- current_location:

**1. Professional Domain Map:**
   - **Core Domains & Time Allocation (Qualitative):**
     - **Career Advancement & Higher Education Strategy (Yocket Engagement):** A significant, concentrated period of activity in June-July 2024. This involved multiple consultations with Yocket.in for visa applications (DS160) and mock interviews. This domain was a primary strategic focus, consuming considerable attention during these months. (Category: Strategic; Decision-making: User as client, Yocket as advisor).
     - **Project Work & Agile Practices (Scrum Activities):** Recurring 15-minute Scrum meetings appear in December 2024 and February 2025, organized by Kanishk and including shwetapardeshi126@gmail.com. This suggests involvement in a project utilizing agile methodology. (Category: Technical/Management; Decision-making: User appears to lead or coordinate these syncs).
     - **Professional Development & Industry Engagement (Data Science Focus):** Attendance at 'Data Con LA 2024' in November 2024, an 8-hour event, indicates a commitment to learning and networking in the data science field. (Category: Learning/Strategic; Decision-making: User initiated attendance).
     - **Focused Problem-Solving/Initiative Development (""Start Solve""):** A self-organized 1-hour event in April 2025 titled 'Start Solve'. This suggests dedicated time for focused work, potentially on a new initiative or complex problem. (Category: Strategic/Technical; Decision-making: User is primary actor).
     - **Academic/Program Networking (""MACC Team 12""):** A 'Coffee Chat' in November 2024 with yinihong@gmail.com related to 'MACC Team 12'. This points to potential involvement in an academic program (e.g., Masters) or a collaborative team project. (Category: Networking/Collaboration; Decision-making: User initiated this chat).
     - **Personal & Financial Administration:** Events like 'FILE ITR, TCS' (June 2025), 'Apple care plus auto-renewal' (May 2025), 'Uber One Cancellation' (Dec 2024), and an older event 'Ajit bday' (Feb 2022) are managed. 'FILE ITR, TCS' may relate to personal tax filing, with TCS being a relevant entity (e.g., employer, past employer, or software). (Category: Personal; Decision-making: User is primary actor).
   - **Evolution of Project Focus:** The Yocket engagement shows a clear progression from initial queries/DS160 preparation to mock interviews over June-July 2024. Scrum activities show recurrence but not enough data for evolutionary trends. 'Start Solve' in April 2025 could mark a new focus.

**2. Key Relationship Network:**
   - **jemini.ganatra@yocket.in (Yocket Consultant):**
     - **Domains/Projects:** Career Advancement & Higher Education Strategy (visa, mocks).
     - **Relationship:** External consultant/advisor. Jemini organizes the meetings, with Kanishk as the client.
     - **Meeting Patterns:** 5 interactions (June-July 2024). Meetings are typically 1:1 between Kanishk and Jemini, or small group sessions where Jemini includes other Yocket specialists (monmee.senapati@yocket.in, deepa.sankar@yocket.in, pavidharini.vijayasekar@yocket.in). Format is consultative.
     - **Communication Cadence/Duration:** Frequent (multiple times a week) during the active engagement period. Meetings are consistently 30 minutes long.
   - **shwetapardeshi126@gmail.com (Collaborator):**
     - **Domains/Projects:** Scrum-based project work.
     - **Relationship:** Appears to be a peer collaborator. Kanishk organizes the Scrum invites they both attend.
     - **Meeting Patterns:** 3 interactions recorded (Dec 2024, Feb 2025). Group setting (Kanishk & Shweta).
     - **Communication Cadence/Duration:** Irregular cadence based on data; meetings are short (15 minutes).
   - **Team Structures & Reporting:** Yocket demonstrates a service delivery team structure with Jemini as a key contact and other specialists engaged as needed. The Scrum setup with Shweta suggests a small, possibly two-person, agile team where Kanishk might have a coordinating role.
   - **External vs. Internal Collaboration:** The data predominantly shows external collaborations: Yocket (consulting), MACC Team 12 (academic/program-related). Shweta Pardeshi's collaboration (Scrum) uses a generic email, making it unclear if it's internal to an organization or an external/personal project; leaning towards external or non-corporate internal.

**3. Work Patterns & Practices:**
   - **Deep Work Methodology:** 'Start Solve' (1 hour, self-scheduled) and attending 'Data Con LA 2024' (8 hours) indicate allocation of time for focused work and immersive learning.
   - **Meeting Preparation/Follow-up:** While not explicitly scheduled, the structured progression of Yocket calls (query -> DS160 form -> mock interviews) implies preparation for each stage.
   - **Decision-Making Forums:** Scrum meetings serve as quick syncs for tactical decisions/updates. Yocket calls are forums for information gathering and strategic decision-making regarding personal career/education goals.
   - **Learning/Development Activities:** Actively pursued through 'Data Con LA 2024' and the Yocket consultation series.
   - **Personal Productivity Systems:** Uses the calendar for diverse purposes: professional meetings, personal administrative reminders ('Apple care', 'Uber One', 'FILE ITR'), focused work blocks ('Start Solve'), and learning events. Preference for short, focused meetings for recurring syncs (15-min Scrums).
   - **Travel & Work Location:** 'Data Con LA 2024' is an in-person event requiring travel to a physical location. Most other meetings have 'Location: n/a', strongly suggesting they are remote/virtual.
   - **Strategic Thinking Time:** Evident in the Yocket engagement, 'Start Solve' block, and attendance at 'Data Con LA'.

**4. Temporal Intelligence:**
   - **Energy Management & Scheduling Preferences:**
     - **High-Priority/External Consultations (Yocket):** Kanishk accommodates very early morning (00:00, 01:30, 03:30 PT) and late evening (22:30 PT) slots, likely to align with external parties in different time zones (e.g., Yocket in India). This indicates high importance placed on these interactions.
     - **Team Syncs (Scrum):** Scheduled flexibly, both late evening (22:30 PT) and late morning (11:00 PT).
     - **Focused Work ('Start Solve'):** Scheduled in late morning (11:00 PT).
     - **Networking ('MACC Coffee Chat'):** Scheduled in the early afternoon (13:00 PT).
     - **Personal Admin:** Often handled midday (12:30 PT).
     - **Learning ('Data Con LA'):** An evening/overnight commitment (19:30 - 03:30 PT).
   - **Protected Times & Boundaries:** The calendar does not show explicitly protected blocks. There's a demonstrated willingness to operate outside typical working hours for critical activities, suggesting flexible boundaries.
   - **Seasonal Workload Variations:** The Yocket engagement created a distinct high-activity period in June-July 2024. Scrum meetings show some clustering. Insufficient data for full year seasonal trends.
   - **Response to High-Pressure Periods:** The Yocket series indicates a methodical approach during the application period, with a sequence of preparatory steps. This suggests focused effort rather than ad-hoc responses.

**5. Support Optimization (Strategies for Assistants/AI):**
   - **Proactive Scheduling for Key Collaborations:** For recurring meetings like Scrums, anticipate scheduling needs. For project-based engagements like Yocket, be prepared for a period of intensive scheduling and coordination.
   - **Time Zone Management:** Diligently manage time zone differences when scheduling with external collaborators, especially those Kanishk accommodates at unusual hours (e.g., Yocket). Confirm Kanishk's preferred slots for such meetings versus his own focused work time.
   - **Protecting Focused Time:** Given Kanishk schedules blocks like 'Start Solve', offer to protect similar slots for deep work or strategic thinking, especially around periods of high meeting density.
   - **Meeting Preparation & Follow-up Support:** For multi-stage engagements (e.g., Yocket series), assist with organizing preparatory materials and summarizing key outcomes or action items.
   - **Learning & Development Curation:** Given attendance at 'Data Con LA', identify and propose relevant conferences, workshops, or courses, particularly in data science or related fields of interest.
   - **Balancing Flexibility and Structure:** While Kanishk is flexible with his hours for important tasks, an assistant can help structure the overall schedule to ensure balance and prevent burnout, perhaps by suggesting buffer times around very early or late meetings.
   - **Clarify Internal/External Context:** For ambiguous collaborations (like Scrum with a generic email), seek clarification if possible to better understand the nature of the project and Kanishk's role for more tailored support.","# Client Hotel Preferences & SOP

Internal vs. External Focus: Based on thread volume and collaborator types, interaction is balanced between internal university contacts (Nihong, Nery, Mrinal) and external personal/administrative contacts (Chase, various service providers). Within the ""professional"" scope defined (academic/career), interaction is primarily internal. When broadening to include significant personal logistics, external interaction volume becomes substantial (~45% Personal Logistics, ~50% Academic, ~5% Career).

## 4. Work Methodology & Operational Patterns

*   **Problem-Solving & Decision-Making:** Kanishk's approach is evident in his personal logistics threads.
    *   When faced with a problem (e.g., health insurance requiring specific proof), he seeks clarification (""Will that suffice?""), explains his perspective (""This seems like an unwarranted request.""), provides alternative evidence (""I have shared all the necessary documents. Having an I-20 means that I am joining an in-person program... Additionally, you can check my program website...""), and states clear potential outcomes (""Let me know if the given documents are enough or whether I should look for another plan."").
    *   When dealing with payment logistics (housing), he is proactive in finding solutions and clarifying details (""Sure Chase, I’ll transfer the money ASAP. Can you share your following details:"", ""Hi Chase, do you have a Zelle account?""). He transparently communicates issues (""Having issues with understanding the various limits and other banking procedures since we are not in the US yet and don’t have a US bank account."") and proposes workarounds (""Is it okay of I send 2000 now, then the rest tomorrow...?"").
    *   Decisions (like accepting the Athena offer, finalizing the apartment) are communicated directly once made. Consensus building in threads is not strongly evident; decisions appear to be made off-email and then communicated.
*   **Information Processing & Management:**
    *   User prefers to request specific information upfront when evaluating options (housing: ""What would be the final monthly rent... What amenities will be included? Are all utilities... included?"").
    *   He shares information and documents efficiently, often summarizing in the email body and attaching files (""I am attaching a zipped file here. It contains the following documents...""). Uses links when relevant (LinkedIn profiles, Wise tracking link).
    *   He follows up on requests when necessary, particularly with external service providers or administrative contacts (""Can you please take a look at this and advise on next steps?"", ""Hey, is there any update on this case?"", ""A gentle reminder for this."").
*   **Productivity & Tools:** Emails indicate usage of Zoom for virtual meetings (""Lets set up a zoom call"", ""KANISHK KALRA is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.""), WhatsApp for communication (""Can contact me on whatsapp at +917289056999"", ""My cousin will call you on WhatsApp""), and various payment platforms (Wise, Zelle, Venmo). Google Docs is used for scheduling (""use this doc... to pick a time""). No specific project management software (Asana/Notion) is referenced.
*   **Professional Persona:** Kanishk's email persona is generally polite, respectful, and goal-oriented. He uses polite openings (""Dear Sir/Ma'am"", ""Hi [Name]"") and closings (""Thanks"", ""Regards"", ""Best regards"", ""Warm regards""). He is direct and concise in his requests and responses. He demonstrates persistence in resolving issues (e.g., Niyo refund, PSI insurance proof). He is organized in providing requested information.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations for Support Optimization

*   **EA Onboarding & Day-to-Day Focus:**
    *   **#1 Priority:** Managing Personal Logistics & Administration threads, particularly those involving critical transactions like housing payments, service issue resolution (insurance, banking), and document submission for enrollment/visa processes. These often involve tight deadlines, detailed information exchange, and potential troubleshooting, requiring careful attention and follow-up.
    *   **Prioritize:**
        *   Triaging and drafting initial responses to inquiries related to renting out his own place (as seen in Threads 1, 2, 3).
        *   Drafting follow-up emails for pending administrative tasks (document submissions, payment confirmations, support requests).
        *   Managing scheduling requests, confirming appointments, and sending calendar invites based on Kanishk's availability (as seen in Threads 9, 16).
        *   Gathering and organizing necessary documents for submission as requested by external parties (university, landlord, etc.).
    *   **Preferred methods for task delegation or updates:** Based on the email style, direct and clear instructions within the email body seem appropriate. For urgent items, flag them explicitly in the subject line or body. Kanishk appears to respond directly within threads, so updates within the relevant email chain are suitable.
*   **Proactive Support Opportunities:**
    *   Monitor critical threads (e.g., housing payments, university requirements, ongoing support cases) for stalled conversations or approaching deadlines and proactively draft follow-up emails for Kanishk's review.
    *   When a thread becomes long or complex (like the Niyo refund thread or the housing payment thread), draft a concise summary highlighting the issue status, key decisions, and next steps required, perhaps before Kanishk needs to send the next reply or before a related meeting.
    *   Identify recurring administrative requests (e.g., needing specific documents, forms) and create templates or checklists for efficient handling.
    *   For ongoing issues (like the Niyo refund), track timelines (e.g., the 60-day chargeback window mentioned) and remind Kanishk or draft follow-ups accordingly.
    *   Anticipate documentation needs based on known upcoming events (e.g., university enrollment requires specific documents).

This profile serves as a starting point; ongoing communication and feedback will allow the EA and AI system to adapt and refine support methods to best match Kanishk's evolving professional activities and communication preferences.","# **Email Style Writing Guide: Kanishk Kalra**

## **Overall Guiding Principles:**

*   **Clear Objective Upfront:** Messages typically begin by immediately stating the reason for writing or the topic of the email.
    *   *Examples:* ""Hey this is available."", ""Just wanted to let you know that I received offers..."", ""I am facing issues while making payment for my health insurance installment."", ""Please check the trailing email that I sent to wellaway regarding the issue with my premium payment."", ""Hey, I am interested."", ""Hi, can we have a virtual meeting/tour to finalize all the details?"", ""Thanks for the update. Can this delivery be expedited please?"", ""Hi, please share an update on my refund."", ""Hi, this is in reference to the above subject."", ""Hey Is there any update on this case? It has been a few days now."", ""I have uploaded my university Admit Letter as proof of full-time student (attached here also). Will that suffice?"", ""Dear Sir/Ma'am This seems like an unwarranted request."", ""Hey, I had two questions:"", ""Hey, I we did a tour with David."", ""Hey, yes I am very much interested!"", ""I wanted to make a reservation with TajIndia Resorts."", ""Hi Paulami I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to kindly request an experience letter from Graviton to support my upcoming US Visa interview."", ""A gentle reminder for this."", ""The Recommendation Letter provided earlier will work. No need for an Experience letter now.""
*   **Provision of Necessary Detail:** Relevant information (account numbers, dates, names, specific issues, documents provided) is included early in the communication or in direct response to a request.
    *   *Examples:* ""Here are some details: Rent - 1195 per month Utilities excluded (around 50 per month)... It is available between june 15 to september 5"", ""Here are my policy details: Name: Kanishk Kalra Policy Number: 05161230 Product: WellAway World Elite Plan: WellAway World Elite Plus Invoice number for payment: 05161230246300"", ""Here are the details: Aadhar number: 590246192151 Update request SRN / URN / EID: S1377699454000"", ""Please find attached the following documents: 1. Signed dispute form 2. Email conversation with merchant (Uber) 3. Screenshot of the uber trip (showing 0 fee) 4. Screenshot of Niyo SBM Debit Card transaction (showing USD 15.72)"", ""I have uploaded my university Admit Letter as proof of full-time student (attached here also)."", ""Here are my details for the same- Location: Mussoorie No. of Members: 3 Members name and age: Jitender Kalra (51), Chanchal Kalra (51), Kanishk Kalra (25) Dates: 25-08-2024 (check-in) / 27-08-2024 (check-out) Membership No.: Tir-3325 Mob.

Here is his linkedin profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrinal-anand-579083148/ We both are from India and are arriving in LA on 10th September.""
*   **Polite Yet Direct:** Communication is polite using terms like ""Please"" and ""Thanks,"" but the user is direct in stating needs, asking questions, and following up persistently when necessary.
    *   *Examples:* ""Please take a look and let me know how to proceed."", ""It would be great if you could send me a payment link"", ""Can you please take a look at this and advise on next steps?"", ""Please check and let me know if you can help me in this regard."", ""Can this delivery be expedited please? I really need this order by 17th December positively. The only reason for me to place this order was because the estimated delivery time was early. Please check into this and get this delivered as soon as possible."", ""Hi, please share an update on my refund. Thanks."", ""Hey Is there any update on this case? It has been a few days now."", ""Please check this as the address update is needed urgently."", ""I am writing to kindly request an experience letter"", ""A gentle reminder for this.""

Thanks, Kanishk"", ""texted you."", ""3107097928"", ""Works."", ""Sure."", ""Cool"", ""Okay."", ""Thanks a lot Chase."", ""Hey Chase Please find attached the signed lease document. Thanks Kanishk"", ""Sounds good, thanks!"".

## **Handling Disagreements or Delivering Difficult News:**

*   When disagreeing or pushing back, the user remains polite but clearly states their position and provides justification. They present evidence or logical arguments. In one case, an ultimatum is presented to prompt a resolution.
    *   *Examples:* ""Dear Sir/Ma'am This seems like an unwarranted request. My classmate who is joining the same program as an international student this Fall has taken the same insurance plan directly from WellAway and they had no such requirement. I have shared all the necessary documents. Having an I-20 means that I am joining an in-person program, which has been thoroughly verified in the visa process. Additionally, you can check my program website also in which it is clear that my program is a full-time in-person one: https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/degrees/master-of-science-in-business-analytics-msba Let me know if the given documents are enough or whether I should look for another plan. Thanks Kanishk""

## **Providing Positive Feedback:**

*   Gratitude is expressed directly, often using ""Thanks,"" ""Thanks a lot,"" or ""Thank you so much.""
    *   *Examples:* ""Thank you so much for all the support and reassurance that you provided during this entire process."", ""Thanks a lot Chase."", ""Sounds good, thanks!"", ""Thanks for the help. Regards."" (In the context of resolving an issue), ""Thanks a lot Chase. Will let you know once we have made the payment.""

## **Providing Negative Feedback:**

*   Negative feedback is typically framed as stating a problem or issue factually rather than criticizing the recipient. It's direct but not confrontational.
    *   *Examples:* ""I am facing issues while making payment for my health insurance installment. The automated payment is not going through and I am not able to find any link to manually make the payment."", ""My June payslip is not available on Paybooks."", ""This seems like an unwarranted request."" (Framed as questioning the validity of the request itself). ""Really sorry about the partial payments this time. Having issues with understanding the various limits and other banking procedures since we are not in the US yet and don’t have a US bank account."" (Acknowledging a problem with his side, but implying external banking system issues).

## **Asking For Feedback/Advice:**

*   Requests for feedback or advice are phrased as direct questions, sometimes listed for clarity. The user asks for information needed to make decisions or understand processes.
    *   *Examples:* ""Let me know if you want a tour or sth"", ""Please take a look and let me know how to proceed."", ""It would be great if you could send me a payment link where I can make this payment. Otherwise, please let me know the issue with the auto-payment."", ""Can you please take a look at this and advise on next steps?"", ""Please check and let me know if you can help me in this regard."", ""In the meantime, can you share more details about this - location, amenities, etc."", ""Will that suffice?"", ""Let me know if the given documents are enough or whether I should look for another plan."", ""Hey, I had two questions: 1. The brochure says... Will all services at Student Health Centre be completely covered...? 2. At multiple places... What does that mean? And how does this work exactly?"", ""Can you share more details on that?"", ""Hey, yes I am very much interested! I just had a few questions: 1. Will we be booking...? What will be the final rent...? how long a lease can we book? 2. Is there air-conditioning...? 3. Are all utilities... included? 4. Can we have a virtual room tour?"", ""Let me know if you need anything else."", ""Should we send our university letters and documents here only? Or do you want us to fill out some application form?"", ""Also, since we are signing the lease for 1 year, would we be allowed to sublease it further for a few months in between..."", ""I wanted to ask what all equipment will be available in the kitchen to us (like fridge, microwave, cooktop, any utensils, etc.), so that we can plan the things to arrange accordingly."", ""Can you share your following details: 1. Full name... 2. This is ACH routing number right? Just confirming. 3. Your account type... 4. Your city, state, zip code, and complete address."", ""do you have a Zelle account? If yes, please share that."", ""Is it okay of I send 2000 now, then the rest tomorrow when the limit resets?"", ""do you have a Venmo account? That probably wouldn’t have these limits."", ""Please confirm.""

## **Asking For Favors:**

*   Requests for assistance or favors are phrased politely, often using ""kindly request"" or ""please."" The reason for the request is sometimes provided (e.g., for visa interview, urgency).
    *   *Examples:* ""I am writing to kindly request an experience letter from Graviton to support my upcoming US Visa interview."", ""Could you please provide me with an official experience letter..."", ""A gentle reminder for this."", ""Can this delivery be expedited please? I really need this order by 17th December positively."", ""Please check this as the address update is needed urgently."", ""Can you share your following details: 1. Full name...""","The user is an MSBA graduate student at UCLA. Their professional activities are centered around their studies and related extracurricular/freelance work.

**Owner's Work and Role:**
The user's work primarily involves:
1.  **Academic Coursework and Projects:** Engaging in rigorous MSBA coursework covering business analytics, data science (including Python-based AI/ML projects, computer vision), economics, and business strategy (e.g., case studies). This involves coding in notebooks, data analysis, creating presentations, and writing reports, both individually and in groups.
2.  **Program-Related Activities & Potential Leadership:** Actively involved in MSBA program activities, possibly in a student leadership, TA, or administrative support capacity. This includes organizing student events (industry nights, seminars, company treks), managing student lists for courses and career services (e.g., resume appointments, group formations), and coordinating program logistics.
3.  **Deal Analysis and Financial Modeling:** Working on financial analysis and deal modeling, primarily using spreadsheets. This could be for coursework, personal projects, or related to their interest in ""deal-related activities.""
4.  **Technical Content Creation/Collaboration:** Evidence suggests involvement (potentially freelance or internship) with an online technical education platform (Educative.io), focusing on creating or managing technical illustrations for computer science, AI/ML concepts.
5.  **Job Seeking and Career Development:** Actively preparing for a career, as shown by resume-related files and participation in career service activities.

**Most Important or Valuable Projects Right Now:**
*   **""AI is reimagining Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)"" document:** Recently active, shared by an external party (VC), indicating relevance to current interests or projects.
*   **""Kodiak"" computer vision project:** A significant collaborative technical project involving notebooks and datasets, worked on with a peer (Shweta Pardeshi).
*   **Technical illustration work for Educative.io:** Ongoing collaboration involving creation/management of visual assets for technical topics.
*   **Recent academic projects/assignments:** Such as the ""Cache presentation"" or economics problem sets.
*   **Personal deal analysis files (e.g., ""Deal_fin""):** Indicates ongoing individual work in this area.
*   The ""Consultant"" spreadsheet is highly active and recent; if the user is actively analyzing or contributing to this, it's very important.

**Recurring Document Types (by purpose):**

*   **Strategic/Analytical Reports & Proposals:** For research, case studies, project planning, and in-depth topic explorations.
*   **Academic/Project Presentations:** For communicating findings, analyses, and project updates.
*   **Financial/Deal Analysis Spreadsheets:** For quantitative modeling, financial evaluation, and deal structuring.
*   **Program/Event Coordination Documents:** For managing student lists, event logistics, and administrative tasks related to the MSBA program.

**Work Alone vs. With Collaborators:**
*   **Solo Work:** Primarily involves personal deal analysis spreadsheets (e.g., ""Deal_fin""), initial drafts of some technical notebooks (""Copy of adhoc.ipynb""), and some presentation preparation (""Copy of Google BS8"" - owned copy).
*   **Collaborative Work:** The majority of academic projects (e.g., ""Cache presentation,"" ""Kodiak project,"" group case studies), coursework assignments (e.g., ""MGMTMSA-404_Economics_PS2""), program administration tasks (e.g., ""MACC Resume Appointments"" involving many UCLA Anderson contacts), and the technical illustration work (with Educative.io contacts). Collaborations typically involve peers, faculty, and external parties.

**How and Where Specifically an AI Assistant Can Help (Non-Obvious/Creative Uses):**
Assuming basic AI uses are covered (research, summarization, drafting, formula generation):
*   **Advanced Literature Synthesis & Hypothesis Generation:** For complex MSBA topics (e.g., specific deep learning architectures for business problems), AI could synthesize cutting-edge research, identify novel cross-disciplinary connections (e.g., applying a CV technique to financial data), and propose unique hypotheses or experimental designs for projects like ""Kodiak"" or new case study analyses.
*   **Automated ""Portfolio-Ready"" Micro-Content Generation:** From completed technical projects (e.g., ""Kodiak.ipynb,"" ""adhoc.ipynb"") or major presentations, AI could generate drafts for LinkedIn posts, concise blog entries explaining a key methodology, or talking points for interviews, helping the user efficiently showcase their work for career purposes.
*   **AI-Powered ""Devil's Advocate"" for Case Studies & Presentations:** User inputs a draft analysis or presentation (e.g., ""Copy of Google BS8,"" ""B/S Group 5 Apple""). AI critically evaluates arguments, identifies logical gaps, suggests counter-arguments, and formulates challenging Q&A scenarios, thereby strengthening the user's analytical rigor and presentation preparedness.
*   **Intelligent Skill Gap Analysis & Personalized Learning Path Curation:** Based on their resume, current technical projects, and program activities (e.g., ""Industry Night"" themes), AI could identify skill gaps for target career roles in Business Analytics/Data Science and curate a personalized learning path, suggesting specific advanced topics, papers, or niche tools to explore for deeper expertise.
*   **Automated Generation of Technical Illustration Briefs & Accessibility Checks:** For the Educative.io work, if the user describes a complex technical concept, AI could generate a detailed illustration brief (key elements, visual metaphors, target audience). It could also analyze draft illustrations for clarity, cognitive load, and accessibility compliance (e.g., color contrast).

**5 Most Important File Types (by purpose) and Recent Examples:**
1.  **Technical Project Notebooks:** For hands-on data science, machine learning model development, and technical analysis.
    *   Recent Example: ""Copy of adhoc.ipynb"" (owned, 87 days ago) or ""Shweta Pardeshi Kodiak.ipynb"" (collaborative, 86 days ago).
2.  **Strategic/Analytical Documents:** For in-depth research, project proposals, business case studies, and analytical reports.
    *   Recent Example: ""AI is reimagining Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)"" (shared, 0 days ago).
3.  **Project/Academic Presentations:** For communicating findings, project work, and case study analyses to peers and faculty.
    *   Recent Example: ""Cache presentation MS Group 7 Slide"" (shared, 53 days ago).
4.  **Financial/Deal Analysis Spreadsheets:** For quantitative business modeling, financial forecasting, and deal evaluation.
    *   Recent Example: ""Deal_fin"" (owned, 148 days ago).
5.  **Technical Illustration Assets/Source Files:** For creating and managing visual content for technical education platforms (assuming this is a professional activity).
    *   Recent Example: Folders like ""Illustrations"" or specific files like ""new. 2025 illustration style.ait"" (shared by Educative.io contacts, some recent activity within 10-20 days).

**New, Non-Basic or Non-Obvious AI Workflows Most Beneficial:**
1.  **Proactive Risk/Opportunity Identification for Academic & Deal Projects:** AI analyzes active project documents (proposals, notebooks, deal sheets), cross-references with academic literature, market data, and even lecture notes. It then flags potential research dead-ends, suggests unexplored (but viable) analytical angles, identifies overlooked market signals for deal analyses, or highlights emerging tools/techniques relevant to the user's specific project, providing proactive guidance.
2.  **AI-Driven Narrative Crafting for Deal Pitches & Strategic Presentations:** Beyond basic copy, AI helps structure the narrative of a deal pitch (derived from ""Deal_fin"" type files) or a strategic presentation (""AI is reimagining SDLC"") tailored to specific audiences (e.g., faculty, VCs, potential employers). It could suggest persuasive storytelling frameworks, anticipate audience concerns, and refine key messages for maximum impact.
3.  **Automated Peer Review Simulation & Feedback Generation:** For group projects or individual assignments before submission (e.g., ""Final Project Proposal,"" ""MGMTMSA-404_Economics_PS2""), the user could have an AI simulate a peer review process. The AI would analyze the document based on typical grading rubrics or project requirements, providing constructive feedback on clarity, completeness, analytical depth, and potential areas of weakness, similar to what a critical classmate or TA might offer.","# Kanishk Kalra Network Context

### 3. Work Patterns & Practices

*   **Deep Work Methodology**: No explicitly scheduled ""focus time"" blocks. Deep work likely occurs in gaps between meetings or during dedicated project work phases (e.g., the Tech Forward Onsite). Mornings before 10 AM and later afternoons might offer some opportunity depending on the day.
*   **Meeting Preparation & Follow-up**: Strong evidence of structured meetings. Uses Google Docs for agendas/notes (""CTO Staff"", ""Type 1 Design Review""), Linear.app for project tracking (""xPilot Standup Board""), and Small Improvements for 1:1s and performance management. This indicates a culture of preparedness and documented outcomes.
*   **Decision-Making Forums**: Key decisions are likely made in ""CTO Staff"", specific project planning meetings (""xPilot Alpha Release Planning""), design reviews (""Type 1 Design Review""), and recruitment debriefs. The ""Tech Forward Onsite"" would also be a critical decision-making event.
*   **Learning/Development Activities**: Actively participates in company-organized learning sessions (""Lean-On-You-Live"", ""Wellness Wednesday"", ""AI Hackathon"", ""Athena Insider"", feedback cycle roadshows), suggesting a commitment to personal and professional growth.
*   **Personal Productivity Systems**: Leverages Google Calendar, Zoom, Google Docs, Linear.app, and Small Improvements.
*   **Travel & Remote/In-Person Balance**: Primarily remote work (many Zoom meetings). However, engages in in-person collaboration for significant events like the ""Tech Forward Onsite"" (Palo Alto) and team social events (dinners/lunches in Palo Alto). Some recurring leadership meetings (""CTO Staff"", ""AI Weekly"") have physical room bookings, suggesting a hybrid option when in the office. No long-distance travel observed in this period.
*   **Strategic Thinking Time Allocation**: Dedicated time for strategic discussions occurs in ""CTO Staff"", ""AI Weekly"", ""Tech Forward"" meetings, the ""Tech Forward Onsite"", and specific project planning/design review sessions. This constitutes a significant portion of his schedule.

### 4. Temporal Intelligence

*   **Energy Management Patterns (Day/Week)**:
    *   **Early Mornings (6-9 AM PST)**: Often company-wide, learning, or optional events; less demanding.
    *   **Mid-Mornings (9 AM-12 PM PST)**: Peak time for core leadership meetings (""CTO Staff"", ""AI Weekly""), interviews, and important external introductions.
    *   **Afternoons (1 PM-5 PM PST)**: Heavily focused on project execution (xPilot standups, bug bashes), technical discussions, 1:1s, and more interviews.
    *   **Evenings**: Generally clear, reserved for personal time or occasional team dinners.
    *   **Weekly Rhythm**: Mondays often start with strategic alignment (CTO Staff). Mid-week is typically packed. Intensity builds around project deadlines (e.g., xPilot launch).
*   **Scheduling Preferences for Activity Types**:
    *   Leadership/Strategy: Mid-mornings.
    *   Project Standups: Mid-afternoons.
    *   Interviews: Spread across mid-morning and afternoon.
    *   1:1s: Mid-day or early afternoon.
    *   Company-wide/Learning: Early mornings.
*   **Protected Times & Boundaries**: No explicit ""no meeting"" blocks. Evenings and weekends are largely protected. Lunch hours are sometimes utilized for meetings. Relies on meeting-free gaps rather than formally blocked personal time.
*   **Seasonal Workload Variations**: Limited data, but the Q1 Feedback Cycle (April-May) clearly introduces a period of increased management workload related to reviews and conversations.
*   **Response to High-Pressure Periods**: The lead-up to the ""xPilot α0 Launch"" (early June) demonstrates intensified activity: daily standups, multiple lengthy bug bashes, and focused launch-prep meetings. This suggests a hands-on, all-in approach during critical delivery phases.

### 5. Support Optimization (Strategies for Assistants)

*   **Prioritize xPilot Related Activities**: Given the current focus, ensure all xPilot meetings are meticulously scheduled, protected, and any necessary prep materials are highlighted.
*   **Manage Recruitment Calendar Actively**: Block sufficient time for interviews and debriefs. Coordinate closely with Dee Wanjiku. Ensure Vasu has candidate materials in advance.
*   **Buffer Time Around Key Meetings**: For strategic meetings like ""CTO Staff"", ""AI Weekly"", and ""Tech Forward Onsite"", consider adding short pre-prep and post-digest blocks if Vasu finds it helpful.
*   **Align with Haider Sabri's EA**: Coordinate closely for scheduling involving Haider, especially for CTO Staff, AI Weekly, and Tech Forward meetings, and their 1:1s.
*   **Clarify In-Person vs. Remote**: For recurring meetings like CTO Staff and AI Weekly that sometimes list physical rooms, confirm Vasu's intended attendance mode to manage travel/commute if necessary.
*   **Leverage Preferred Tools**: Continue using Google Docs for agendas, Linear.app for project updates, and Small Improvements for 1:1s. Ensure links are always in calendar invites.
*   **Strategic Time Blocking**: Proactively discuss with Vasu if he'd benefit from explicitly blocked ""focus time"" slots, especially during non-peak project phases, perhaps on Friday afternoons or early mornings.
*   **Track Project Cycles**: Be aware of project milestones (like xPilot α0). Expect increased meeting load and need for flexibility during ramp-up and launch periods. Similarly, be mindful of HR cycles like performance reviews.
*   **Consolidate Learning Events**: Group optional learning/company-wide events if possible, or ensure they are clearly marked as optional, to help Vasu prioritize his core responsibilities.
*   **Meeting Cadence for 1:1s with Jon**: Ensure the weekly 30-min slot for ""1:1 Vasu & Jon"" is consistently protected. Check if other direct reports need similar recurring slots.
*   **External Meeting Preparedness**: For external meetings like vendor demos or strategic intros, ensure clear objectives, attendee lists, and company backgrounds are provided to Vasu beforehand.",,,"# Vasu Sharma Professional Profile & AI/EA Style Guide

## 4. Work Methodology & Operational Patterns

**Problem-Solving & Decision-Making:**
Vasu's approach to problem-solving is collaborative and technically grounded. He engages peers (Chong, Ousmane) in detailed discussions about technical architecture and challenges, such as memory management in AI systems: ""Second Chong as well! Definitely not much novelty except for the representation formats. We do need a clear distinction between long and short term memory though and figure out update policies, conflict handling and updation over time for them."" (Thread 34). He seeks input from colleagues with specific expertise (Ousmane on candidate background in Thread 53). Decisions seem to be made through discussion and consensus within the team, or explicitly requested from leadership (""Could we approve the 5K...?"" - Jon asking Haider, referencing discussion with Vasu in Thread 43; Haider's approval follows). Vasu also makes direct decisions regarding candidate suitability (""I like his profile. Lets definitely engage!"" - Thread 55, ""Interesting profile. I agree, we should chat!"" - Thread 54).

**Information Processing & Management:**
Vasu shares information clearly and directly when requested, often providing detailed specifics (""Here is it: Bio: Vasu brings over a decade..."", ""Fun facts: Vasu is a world traveller..."", Thread 31). He requests information explicitly (""Can you give this one to Ousmane or Daniel Rojas instead?"" - Thread 6, ""Could you check and let me know if it looks good?"" - Thread 30). He references or uses shared documents (Google Docs/Slides in Threads 19, 36) and platforms like Glue for quick communication (""I reached out on Glue, but you must be away."" - Thread 41). Vasu follows up on important requests, especially administrative or time-sensitive ones, if he doesn't receive a timely response: ""Following up on this once. I started here on the 7th April and havent received a paycheck yet."" (Thread 42), ""Quickly wanted to circle back on this as the conference is starting in 3 days, so would love to get everything ready ASAP."" (Thread 43).

**Productivity & Tools:**
Mentioned tools/platforms include: Google Meet/Zoom (meetings), Google Calendar (scheduling), Gmail (primary communication), Google Docs/Slides (documents), DocuSign (offer letters), Glue (internal chat/quick syncs), LinkedIn (candidate profiles). Specific AI frameworks/concepts referenced include: crewAI, OpenAI SDK, MCP protocols, A2A frameworks, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), memory management (Memento), planning (axon\_planner.py). His emails indicate comfort discussing specific technical concepts and evaluating tools based on their technical capabilities and relevance to Athena's AI goals.

**Professional Persona:**
Vasu's persona is results-oriented and technically focused (""building always takes priority... cant recruit if we cant prove that we can build. Will always keep my focus there :)"" - Thread 43). He is supportive of new hires and interns (""Looking forward to having you Shweta and Kanishk!"" - Thread 5, ""Yayyy!!!! Connected you to Esteban."" - Thread 24). He is direct and concise in his communications (""Can we move this to Thursday?"" - frequent request to Dee). He expresses enthusiasm for exciting technology (""This is super cool and sooooo relevant."" - Thread 14, ""This is extremely incredible."" - Thread 16). He balances technical depth with practical considerations (discussing data collection trade-offs like video vs. screenshots in Thread 28).

**EA Onboarding & Day-to-Day Focus:**

The top 3-5 areas for an EA to prioritize understanding and managing are:

1.  **Calendar Management & Interview Scheduling (Priority #1):** Vasu frequently needs to reschedule meetings due to conflicts (Threads 6, 13, 17, 21, 23, 33, 37, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51). The volume of recruiting interviews requires constant coordination with candidates and multiple internal team members (Yen, Dee, Chong, Ousmane, Rahul, Peter, Jon, Jinghao). The EA must proactively monitor Vasu's calendar, anticipate potential conflicts, and handle rescheduling requests efficiently and courteously with candidates and internal participants. Example task: Receive a new interview invite, check Vasu's availability, proactively suggest alternative times if needed, and communicate changes to all parties via email.
2.  **Recruiting Process Support:** Manage candidate correspondence (acknowledgments, sending standard information like the job description/responsibilities overview provided in Thread 10), track candidate status (which interview round, who is interviewing), coordinate internal debriefs or feedback collection.
3.  **Information Management & Triage:** Handle incoming external inquiries (like vendor pitches - Thread 4), route them appropriately, or draft polite responses if not relevant. Organize and flag important internal discussions or documents.
4.  **HR/Operations Follow-up:** Proactively follow up on pending administrative tasks initiated by Vasu (e.g., offer letter status, payroll inquiries, onboarding logistics) with relevant internal teams (Jon, Yen, Dee, Light, Esteban).
5.  **Drafting Routine Emails:** Draft simple, standard emails based on Vasu's common communication patterns (e.g., rescheduling requests, acknowledgments, introductions based on templates).

**Prime Candidates for EA/AI Management:**

*   Emails requesting to schedule or reschedule meetings.
*   Initial acknowledgments to external contacts (candidates, vendors).
*   Sending standard information (like the internship description used in Thread 10).
*   Following up on simple action items assigned to others (e.g., ""Could you send out Amir's offer letter?"" - EA could follow up with Jon if no response).

**Preferred Methods for Task Delegation/Updates:**

Vasu delegates tasks directly within email threads, often tagging individuals (""@Dee Wanjiku <dee.wanjiku@athena.com> can you move this..."", Thread 21). Updates should likely be provided via email for formal closure, or potentially via Glue for quick status checks if that is the established team practice.

**Proactive Support Opportunities:**

*   **Anticipatory Scheduling:** Monitor Vasu's calendar and known project phases (e.g., active hiring sprints, upcoming onsite meetings) to predict busy periods and proactively block time or suggest rescheduling less critical meetings *before* conflicts arise.
*   **Interview Logistics Streamlining:** Develop a system with Yen/Dee/Jon to streamline the interview scheduling process, potentially using scheduling tools if not already fully utilized, and providing candidates with all necessary information upfront (Zoom link, interviewer names, resume confirmed).
*   **Thread Summarization:** For long or complex email threads related to projects (like the ""Long-Term Memory"" discussion - Thread 34) or external evaluations (Anthropic - Thread 7), provide Vasu with a concise summary before related meetings or follow-ups.
*   **Information Compilation:** If Vasu is evaluating a new tool or partnership, proactively compile relevant information from previous emails or shared documents.
*   **Recruiting Pipeline Management:** Keep a clear overview of candidates Vasu is involved with, noting next steps and following up with internal interviewers or HR to keep the process moving. Flag candidates requiring specific information (like CPT letter details).","# **Email Style Writing Guide for Vasu Sharma <vasu.sharma@athena.com>**

## **Overall Guiding Principles**

Based on the provided emails, Vasu's communication style is generally direct, action-oriented, and concise, particularly in replies and scheduling requests. Longer emails are structured with clear points. He often uses casual greetings like ""Hey"" and signs off with ""Regards"" or ""Best"" (less frequently).

*   **Focus on the main point quickly:**
    *   ""Thanks for sharing access to this! It's super cool and I am thoroughly impressed by what you have built here. Would love to get on a call and understand the functionality more deeply and also share more feedback. In the meantime, here are some quick line items for feedback and questions:""
    *   ""Could be very interesting! Would love to join the meeting and see how this can fit in our plans.""
    *   ""Can you give this one to Ousmane or Daniel Rojas instead? I will be busy with some other meetings with Jonathan on 12th and 13th.""
    *   ""Me and Chong can greet the interns in office when they come :)""
*   **Structured feedback or points when detailed:**
    *   Uses bullet points for specific feedback:
        *   ""- The Y-1 model seems to have additional latency compared to other models, my assumption is thats due to the memory management part but it can make for a drop in the UX experience given that the user has to wait much longer for simple responses. Having a pre determination step to see if memory is needed can help avoid that additional thinking time for simpler queries""
        *   ""- I have often noticed that the model keeps waiting even after the response is complete and refuses to accept new queries in that meantime, not sure if its a bug or if it is doing some post processing?""
        *   ""- I tried to get it to tell me about all the memory summary it has on me. I gave it complete access of my email and calender but I wasnt able to fully retrieve what it knows about me. Would be curious to understand how the memory is being built and stored.""
*   **Clear requests for actions:**
    *   ""Can you give this one to Ousmane or Daniel Rojas instead?""
    *   ""Could you help create the letter for Kanishk.""
    *   ""Can I get developer access approval to test it out?""
    *   ""We should actually try asking them if they will give us early access.""
    *   ""Would love an intro so that we can ask for early and beta access""
    *   ""Can we move this to Monday or anytime else next week.""
    *   ""Could you check and let me know if it looks good?""
    *   ""Could you send out Amir's offer letter?""

## **Audience-Specific Styles**

### **Internal - Senior Leadership (Jonathan Swanson, Haider Sabri)**

*   **A. Greetings & Openings:** Uses ""Hey"" or ""Hi"". Responds directly to previous points or initiates with a relevant observation or request.
    *   ""Hey Haider,""
    *   ""Hey Jon,"" (To Jon Joseph LoCurto, included here due to role in key discussions with leadership)
    *   ""Hi Haider,""
    *   Starts replies by immediately addressing the forwarded content or previous email's subject: ""100% agree! The web as we know it is going to change..."" (Reply to Haider Sabri)
    *   ""Could be very interesting! Would love to join the meeting and see how this can fit in our plans."" (Reply to Jonathan Swanson)
    *   ""This is super cool and sooooo relevant. We absolutely have to try this out!"" (Reply to Jonathan Swanson)
    *   ""This is extremely incredible."" (Reply to Jonathan Swanson)
*   **B. Tone & Language:** Professional yet enthusiastic and engaged, especially when discussing new technology or strategy. Uses slightly more formal structure for detailed points but remains concise. Uses strong agreement phrases.
    *   ""100% agree!""
    *   ""This is super cool and sooooo relevant.""
    *   ""This is extremely incredible.""
    *   ""I totally agree with their pitch and do think that competing over having the ""best"" model is a never ending cash fuelled arms race with only losers in the long term and no real winners, so something has to change,""
    *   ""Lets get all of these people together and make them meet the team. Nothing to get the creative juices flowing like having some really smart people in the same room!""
    *   ""I 100% agree, building always takes priority... cant recruit if we cant prove that we can build.""
*   **C. Structure & Formatting:** Can be paragraph form or use bullet points for specific feedback/questions. Often quotes the previous email inline (standard reply format).
    *   Example with paragraph structure and specific question: ""My first take on this is to collect screenshots (videos are expensive to store and use), along with as much metadata that we can possibly get. Most important metadata will be start and end markers for actions taken to solve a particular subtask, the associated communication thread, historical preference data for client, if possible then the plan of action the EA followed etc. Interesting, I totally agree with their pitch and do think that competing over having the ""best"" model is a never ending cash fuelled arms race with only losers in the long term and no real winners, so something has to change, but as long as VCs pour billions into it (which they seem to be trigger happy doing), the war will go on. Curious to see how SSI is planning to leapfrog the others and break this wheel?""
    *   Example in response to request: ""I have completed 3.""
*   **D. Common Phrases or Idiosyncrasies:** Uses phrases indicating strong agreement, enthusiasm, or expressing curiosity. Asks direct questions about strategic implications or next steps.
    *   ""100% agree!""
    *   ""super cool""
    *   ""sooooo relevant""
    *   ""extremely incredible""
    *   ""Curious how they are differentiating themselves...""
    *   ""Curious to see how SSI is planning to leapfrog the others and break this wheel?""
    *   ""Would love an intro so that we can ask for early and beta access""
    *   ""Lets get all of these people together...""
    *   ""I 100% agree...""
*   **E. Communication Patterns The User Seems to Avoid:** Does not use overly formal business jargon. Avoids excessive pleasantries or lengthy introductions when replying.
*   **F. Closing & Sign-off:** Uses ""Regards"" or ""Best"".
    *   ""Regards Vasu""
    *   ""Thanks, Vasu""

Vasu's key engagement today, June 16th, is the recurring 90-minute CTO Staff meeting at 10:00 AM PT, organized by Haider and involving the CTO staff. This meeting serves as a regular coordination point, as indicated by an agenda and action items document. This is the only event provided for the period, highlighting it as a current priority.

Vasu is driving several key AI initiatives. He's seeking technical details from the Superchat team (Chris York, Carlos Lucero) to enhance xPilot's memory capabilities and is awaiting their response. Strategic discussions also continue with leadership on harnessing Athena's data for AI agent training, focusing on data collection and xPilot. On the team front, new intern Kanishk Kalra started today and requires Vasu's guidance on next steps. Vasu also recently interviewed Akshay Koul for an AI role. The evaluation of Anthropic's AI products is ongoing, with Vasu having connected for technical discussions.

Vasu has been initiating new documents this past week. One is a Google Doc titled ""Hiring-Manager Justification – Subba Koduri,"" suggesting activity related to a hiring process. Another new Google Doc, ""Building and Training xPilot task Automation Agents,"" indicates work on a project focused on automation. Both documents were recently named and then shared for viewing with the athena.com domain, likely for internal review or dissemination.

### 3. Work Patterns & Practices

Chris exhibits highly structured and intentional work practices, leveraging systems for productivity and continuously seeking improvement.

*   **Deep Work Methodology:**
    *   Schedules long, uninterrupted blocks (2-8 hours) for deep work or co-working (e.g., sessions with Arthur Kaneko, Kristen Berman, Jonathan Swanson). Often utilizes external locations like cafes or co-working spaces for these.
    *   Uses ""DNS"" (Do Not Schedule) blocks in his calendar for focused, individual work.
*   **Meeting Preparation & Follow-up:**
    *   Events sometimes include links to preparatory materials (Loom videos, Google Docs, Tome) in descriptions, indicating thorough preparation.
    *   Utilizes Apple Notes for capturing information (inferred from `applenotes://` links in descriptions).
*   **Decision-Making Forums:**
    *   Utilizes focused 1:1s for many decisions. Larger group meetings (e.g., ""Athena/PwC Tax - Functional Discussion"") for broader input or formal discussions.
*   **Learning/Development Activities:**
    *   Proactively enrolls in webinars and programs (e.g., Ben Tossell's AI Marketing Program, AI Agent workshops) and has recurring learning sessions (e.g., ""AI Session with Nathan""). Focus areas: AI, automation, marketing, productivity.
*   **Personal Productivity Systems:**
    *   Meticulous calendar management for both professional and personal life, including travel, appointments, and even buffer times (e.g., ""Check-in"" before appointments).
    *   Heavy reliance on delegation (central to his work at Athena and personal philosophy - ""Delegation Manifesto"").
    *   Multi-platform for communication (Zoom, Teams, Meet, Cal.com for scheduling). Shows keen interest in automation tools.
*   **Travel Patterns & Remote/In-Person Work Balance:**
    *   Frequent international travel (Bali, Kuala Lumpur, US - SFO/Oakland, Puerto Rico, Taipei, Milwaukee for personal). Balances periods of being settled (e.g., Bali for several months) with travel bursts for in-person meetings.
    *   Effectively blends remote collaboration (many Zoom meetings) with high-value in-person interactions.
    *   Blocks out all travel logistics meticulously (flights, ground transport, check-ins).
*   **Strategic Thinking Time Allocation:**
    *   Embedded within deep work sessions, co-working with thought leaders, and dedicated learning activities.

### 4. Temporal Intelligence

Chris manages his time and energy with clear patterns and preferences, adapting to a global work style.

*   **Energy Management Patterns (Day/Week):**
    *   Meeting schedule adapts to his current time zone, often involving early morning or late evening calls to sync with global collaborators.
    *   Regularly schedules personal well-being activities (massages, fitness like ""Press Handstand"", ""Side Splits"") often in the mid to late afternoon, suggesting a routine for de-stressing and maintaining energy.
    *   No rigid daily template, but rather blocks of different types of work (meetings, deep work, learning, personal care).
*   **Scheduling Preferences for Different Activity Types:**
    *   Deep work/co-working: Extended blocks (half-day to full-day).
    *   Standard meetings: 30-60 minutes for 1:1s.
    *   Learning: Often evening slots (corresponding to US daytime if he's in Asia/PR).
    *   Personal care: Integrated into the work week, not just weekends.
*   **Protected Times and Boundaries:**
    *   ""DNS"" blocks indicate protected focus time.
    *   Consistent scheduling of personal wellness appointments (massages, fitness, doctor's visits) shows these are prioritized boundaries.
    *   Travel days are heavily structured around logistics, minimizing other commitments.
*   **Seasonal Workload Variations:**
    *   Workload appears consistently high. Intensity may shift based on location – travel periods (e.g., to SF Bay Area) are dense with external meetings, while periods in a single location (e.g., Bali) might allow for more deep work and routine.
*   **Response to High-Pressure Periods (e.g., Travel):**
    *   Manages pressure through meticulous pre-planning and scheduling of all logistical steps.
    *   Integrates wellness activities (massages) possibly as a recovery mechanism, though not always directly tied to high-pressure events. The regularity itself is a proactive measure.

### 5. Support Optimization (Strategies for Assistants)

Based on Chris York's identified patterns, an assistant can provide optimal support through the following strategies:

1.  **Master Proactive & Meticulous Scheduling:**
    *   Mirror his detailed approach to calendar management. Block travel time, including pre-airport check-ins, transit, and buffer periods, for all professional and personal travel.
    *   Manage scheduling across multiple time zones effectively, always clarifying his current location and preferred work blocks.
2.  **Guard Protected Time:**
    *   Recognize and protect ""DNS"" blocks and recurring personal wellness appointments (massages, fitness, health check-ups). Query before scheduling over these.
3.  **Facilitate Deep Work & Strategic Sessions:**
    *   Assist in preparing for deep work by gathering/organizing necessary links or documents if shared (he sometimes includes these in invites).
    *   When he has co-working sessions, ensure locations and logistics are confirmed.
4.  **Streamline Collaborator Engagement:**
    *   Manage scheduling with key recurring collaborators (Arthur Kaneko, Kristen Berman, Samuel Salzer, Daniel Gruneberg, Nathan Labenz, Haider Sabri, Teddy Daiell), understanding their typical meeting cadences and durations.
    *   Help track follow-ups or action items if this is part of the delegation workflow.
5.  **Support Learning & Development:**
    *   Track and remind him of scheduled webinars or learning sessions.
    *   Potentially help research or filter new learning opportunities based on his interests in AI, automation, and marketing.
6.  **Information Management:**
    *   Be aware of his use of Apple Notes. If part of the workflow, assist in organizing notes or extracting information for meetings.
7.  **Communication & Tool Agility:**
    *   Be proficient with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Understand his use of Cal.com for external scheduling.
8.  **Anticipate Travel Needs:**
    *   Proactively gather details for upcoming travel: flight info, accommodation confirmations, ground transport options, visa requirements if applicable.
9.  **Understand His Domains:**
    *   Develop a working knowledge of his key professional domains (Athena, delegation, AI, VC, advisory work) to better contextualize requests and communications.
10. **Embrace Delegation:**
    *   As Chris is a proponent of delegation, be proactive in identifying tasks that can be offloaded and learn his systems for doing so effectively (referencing his work on ""Assistant Training & Automation Workflow"").","# Client Hotel Preferences & Booking SOP

## 8. Service Preferences & Special Requests:

*   **Always request a Non-Smoking Room.**

## 4. Work Methodology & Operational Patterns

**Problem-Solving & Decision-Making:**

Chris's approach involves a combination of technical analysis, strategic evaluation, and reliance on expert input, often mediated through his EA. When facing technical issues, he provides detailed reports and examples: ""Despite multiple attempts, the tool is not generating the app as requested. Here are the details: - *Issue with App Generation:* The tool consistently fails... - *Enhance Prompt Function:* When I use the 'Enhance Prompt' feature..."". Decisions are often communicated directly and concisely, delegating the implementation or coordination: ""We will put Marj for now and can update it later."", ""Find a time for us"". He solicits specific input from collaborators (""If you have any questions about how to implement, let me know."", ""Do you think there's another option I'm missing, or should I just flesh out one or both of the above next?""). He also provides detailed, analytical feedback to guide others' decisions, as seen in the extensive Airtable feedback: ""The main problem with onboarding is that it forces you into things before having you understand what's going on... Shoving someone in the app UI before they have seen the real product will only 1) cause confusion, 2) increase churn, and 3) reduce every other metric they claim to care about..."".

**Information Processing & Management:**

Chris processes information efficiently, preferring summarized insights, especially from automated workflows: ""I didn't think it was worth my time to read, so Carlos built an automation that has an LLM read each chapter and summarize it + extract quotes."" He relies heavily on shared documents (Google Docs, Sheets, Figma) and links to tools or resources to convey detailed information or provide context: ""Below are some links for those 3 topics, to at least get you some context in the interim."". Visual aids (screenshots, Loom videos) are frequently used to illustrate technical points or workflows. Follow-up on requests is often managed by his EA, Carlos, who coordinates scheduling and tracks necessary documentation (e.g., chasing tax documents).

**Productivity & Tools:**

Chris is deeply engaged with and frequently references a wide array of AI and automation tools. Key mentions include:
*   **Automation/Workflow:** n8n (""This email was sent automatically with n8n"", ""https://n8n.chrisyork.co/""), Zapier (mentioned as an alternative).
*   **Data Management/Workflow:** Airtable (used in recruiting, discussed extensively for product feedback), Clay (used for recruiting).
*   **AI Models/Platforms:** ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini (referenced in book summary), OpenAI 4o mini (used in Task Arcade), R1 (tested for creative writing), Honcho (testing API access).
*   **AI Development Tools:** Bolt, Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Replit (app builders, coding AI, hosting).
*   **Specialized AI Tools:** Firecrawl (scraping, bug reported), Suno (music gen), Fal.ai/Kling (video gen), Retro Diffusion/Scenario AI (image gen), Sheets GPT (spreadsheet AI), Superwhisper, WisprFlow, Aqua (voice productivity), Descript (video demo/editing), Martin (scheduling AI - noted as non-functional/needs support).
*   **Other Tools:** Google Sheets/Docs/Drive (collaboration, document storage), Figma (design review), Github (code repository, backup), Supabase (backend/database), Stacker, Glide, Softr (app building/dashboards).

**Professional Persona:**

Based on his communication, Chris York's professional demeanor is highly analytical, results-oriented, and pragmatic. He is direct and concise in his writing, valuing efficiency and clarity (""Thanks!"", ""--Chris"", uses bullet points). He is enthusiastic about technology, particularly AI and automation, and explores their potential applications rigorously. He acts as a knowledgeable expert, providing detailed feedback and strategic insights across various domains. He is supportive of his team members' development (guiding Ann on Task Arcade) and actively collaborates by sharing knowledge and resources. He manages relationships effectively, often through his EA, maintaining a professional yet sometimes informal tone depending on the contact (""Hey guys,"").

## 5. Actionable Recommendations for Support Optimization

**EA Onboarding & Day-to-Day Focus:**

1.  **#1 Priority: Scheduling & Calendar Management (via Carlos Lucero):** This is the most visible and frequent interaction point handled by the EA. Chris's travel (Bali, PST, WITA, future locations) makes time zone coordination complex and rescheduling frequent. The EA must be proficient in managing dynamic availability, coordinating across multiple parties (including other EAs), and utilizing calendar tools effectively. Focus on mastering Chris's current location and preferred meeting windows, and anticipating the need for rescheduling due to travel or changing priorities.
    *   ""Chris is in Bali so time zones may be a little tricky, but here are a few time slots that work for Chris next week...""
    *   ""Chris is traveling the entire week and schedules right now are very unclear...""
    *   ""Would Sarah be available in the next couple of weeks between *9 AM – 12 PM Bali Time (5 PM – 8 PM PT)?* Any time later in the day also works fine.""
2.  **Information & Document Management:** Chris shares and receives information via various links (Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, Figma, Loom, product links). The EA needs to effectively organize these resources, ensure access is available to relevant parties, track follow-ups related to shared information (e.g., checking if Figma access was granted, reminding about feedback deadlines), and potentially summarize key documents before meetings.
    *   ""Here are the files as requested. Appreciate the patience.""
    *   ""Can drop this in your file once you give edit permissions, right now I can't even view your Figma""
    *   ""Following the call with Chris York last March 11, we are also sending herewith a copy of the interview notes... for your file and reference.""
3.  **Operational Task Coordination (Especially Tax/Finance):** Managing communication and providing necessary documents to external vendors like tax accountants is crucial for compliance. This involves tracking deadlines, gathering information (like P&L/Balance Sheets), confirming details, and coordinating payments based on Chris's approval.
    *   ""Apologies for the late revert - yes right now the final number is not yet available, so let's file the extension.""
    *   ""Please use this updated card for the filing of the $150 fee. [Link]""
    *   ""Unfortunately, we will need confirmation to make this $5,005 payment as well, do we have confirmation to file and pay this annual report extension...""
4.  **AI Tooling Awareness & Basic Support:** While Chris is the AI expert, the EA should be aware of the tools he uses and tests. This includes understanding the general purpose of tools like n8n, Airtable, Clay, Bolt/Cursor, etc., being able to relay bug reports or support requests accurately, and potentially assisting with basic onboarding or access coordination for these tools when directed.
    *   ""I am writing to report a bug with Bolt.new that I encountered recently.""
    *   ""Sure, send an access code or API key and we'll check it out.""
    *   ""Carlos definitely does not have the time to support this; we're very behind on a lot of important other stuff like the AI chat tool...""

**EA/AI Task Delegation & Management:**

*   **Email Triage & First Responses (EA/AI):** Filter out routine updates or simple requests that can be answered or acknowledged by the EA or AI (""Thanks!"", ""Got it"", ""Will coordinate...""). Flag important requests for information, scheduling, review/approval, or action requiring Chris's direct input. AI can draft initial acknowledgments or simple answers based on pre-approved phrases or extracted information (e.g., confirming receipt of documents, providing standard time slots based on calendar data).
*   **Scheduling (EA):** The EA is the primary owner of scheduling, coordinating availability across time zones and multiple parties. This is a core delegated function.
    *   ""I'm helping coordinate Chris's schedule.""
    *   ""Carlos and your EA can work to get something scheduled.""
*   **Information Requests & Updates (EA):** The EA handles requests for documents, updates on tasks, and relays information back to external parties or internal colleagues.
*   **Drafting Communications (AI/EA):** AI could assist in drafting concise, bulleted updates or status reports based on task management tools (like Asana, as demonstrated in the daily report workflow). The EA would review and edit these drafts. AI could also draft initial responses to meeting requests or standard inquiries, adhering to Chris's direct and professional tone.
*   **Proactive Support Opportunities (EA/AI):**
    *   **Chasing Follow-ups:** The EA should proactively follow up on outstanding requests sent by Chris or by the EA on his behalf, especially to external parties or vendors with deadlines (e.g., tax documents from Ignacio, responses from Katelyn/Dalton/Jungwon). AI could potentially monitor threads for lack of response after a set period and draft polite nudge emails for EA review.
    *   **Summarizing Long Threads/Documents (AI):** Before meetings or when Chris is catching up after travel, an AI-generated summary of relevant email threads or linked documents could save significant time.
    *   **Identifying Recurring Tasks/Information Needs (AI/EA):** Analyze communication patterns to identify recurring requests (like tax documents, subscription renewals, specific types of AI tool support issues) to proactively prepare information or anticipate needs.

**Preferred Methods for Delegation & Updates:**

*   Task delegation to Carlos is typically done via email, often initiated by Chris or resulting from a discussion where Chris gives direction. Instructions are usually clear and concise, sometimes with links or specific parameters.
*   Updates from Carlos to Chris are less visible in these threads, but inferred to involve communication about scheduling status, completion of delegated tasks (like payments or document sharing), and summarizing interactions with external parties. The AI Daily Report workflow suggests a preference for structured, summarized updates on ongoing tasks, ideally delivered via a medium like WhatsApp.

*(Note: Specific instructions on 'Handling Disagreements' were not evident in the provided threads.)*","# **Email Style Writing Guide for Chris York (c@chrisyork.co)**

## **Overall Guiding Principles**

-   Emails are direct, concise, and often action-oriented or informative.
-   Prefers bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when conveying multiple pieces of information, questions, or findings.
    -   Example:
        ```
        Couple notes:
        * We have not added the AI suggested follow up tasks yet, but will have
        that in there soon.
        * We were not able to see in the Asana API how your EAs mark when a task
        is started.
        * The same is true for blocked tasks.
        Things you may want to provide input on:
        * Time you want the email each day.
        * We sorted by oldest tasks first--maybe you prefer newest tasks first.
        * If you want us to omit things like tasks older than a certain age.
        * If you prefer another communication medium over email, like a chat app.
        * If you want us to attempt Asana app deeplinks vs web URLs for tasks
        * Your preferred definition of ""stale"" tasks;
        * If you want us to exclude any Asana workspace members from the
        workflow.
        * Asana projects to include/exclude from the workflow.
        * Any changes to the format.
        * AI ideas, etc.
        ```
    -   Example:
        ```
        Attached PDF:
        * Receipt for successful transaction within the last 30 days
        * Last 4 digits 5871 prominently featured at top left
        * Name matches my legal name and name registered on Bright Data
        —Chris
        ```
-   Uses a consistent simple closing format, typically just his first name or ""--Chris"".
    -   Example: ""—Chris""
    -   Example: ""--Chris""

## **Audience-Specific Styles**

### **External - Investors/Potential Investors**

-   *Based on the limited data (Sarah Tavel), interaction is handled by EA Carlos Lucero for scheduling.*

### **External - Key Partners/Collaborators**

-   **A. Greetings & Openings:** Uses simple greetings.
    -   Example: ""Hi,"" (to help@firecrawl.com)
    -   Example: ""Hey Luke, great to be connected."" (to Luke Drago)
    -   Example: ""Hi Elizabeth,"" (to Elizabeth Park)
    -   Example: ""Hi there,"" (to hello@stackblitz.com)
    -   Example: ""Hey Sofia!"" (to Sofia Garcia - note this contact appears in older threads and may represent a different relationship stage/type)
-   **B. Tone & Language:** Tone is professional yet can be direct and critical when providing feedback or reporting issues. Uses clear, specific language, especially when describing technical issues or providing detailed feedback.
    -   Example: ""I am writing to report a bug with Bolt.new that I encountered recently.""
    -   Example: ""The tool consistently fails to generate the app I specified. Instead of providing the expected output, it returns an error message stating “FORBIDDEN” even after modifying the prompt.""
    -   Example: ""My full legal name is ""Christopher"" wheres the document says ""Chris"", although obviously it was e-signed and has my correct email, so this may not be an issue.""
    -   Example: ""The explanation is very clear.""
    -   Example: ""I think the idea of adding a column/field being a key behavior that is likely to have predictive value for the user upgrading is kind of insane.""
    -   Example: ""Frankly, if their product team had executed better, the sync table is probably the one you'd prioritize in onboarding, but for now, it probably makes more sense to do Google Sheets or Excel.""
    -   Example: ""Shoving someone in the app UI before they have seen the real product will only 1) cause confusion, 2) increase churn, and 3) reduce every other metric they claim to care about, since most of the actions related to those metrics are not even accessible there.""
-   **C. Structure & Formatting:** Uses bullet points and numbered lists to organize detailed points, questions, or feedback. Uses bolding (indicated by asterisks) for emphasis or headings within lists.
    -   Example:
        ```
        Here are the details:
        - *Issue with App Generation:* The tool consistently fails to generate
        the app I specified.
        - *Enhance Prompt Function:* When I use the “Enhance Prompt” feature,
        the text field is cleared,
        - *Subscription Concerns:* I am on the $100 monthly subscription plan
        and expected full functionality.
        ```
    -   Example:
        ```
        1) The explanation is very clear.
        2) Are they really trying to prioritize SMBs?
        3) Are they explicitly looking for AI-forward solutions
        4) In terms of format, do you have a strong preference
        ```
    -   Example: Uses nested bullet points and bolded sub-headers for in-depth feedback.
        ```
        Key Behavior 1: Simple actions
        Key Behavior 1.1: Creating a Field
        Creating a field is extremely easy...
        And if we're going to have somebody add a field...
        Key Behavior 1.2: Creating a View
        Adding a view is kind of odd as a key behavior...
        ```
-   **D. Common Phrases or Idiosyncrasies:**
    -   Uses phrases to introduce questions or points for discussion.
        -   Example: ""Here are some ideas.""

    -   Directly asks clarifying questions.
        -   Example: ""Do you have screenshots of all the onboarding, sharing, app creation, etc flows being referred to?""
        -   Example: ""Are they explicitly looking for AI-forward solutions... or are general UX fixes in scope?""
    -   Highlights findings or observations clearly.
        -   Example: ""We've checked everything on our end and found no reason we're the ones causing this issue.""
    -   Uses stark language when criticizing product issues.
        -   Example: ""executed the most shittily""
        -   Example: ""literally insane""
        -   Example: ""way shittier example data""
-   **E. Communication Patterns The User Seems to Avoid:** Excessive politeness or hedging when providing critical feedback; vague descriptions of problems.
-   **F. Closing & Sign-off:** Consistently uses ""—Chris"".
    -   Example: ""—Chris""

### **External - Vendors/Service Providers**

-   **A. Greetings & Openings:** Uses standard formal or semi-formal greetings.
    -   Example: ""Hi,"" (to help@firecrawl.com)
    -   Example: ""Hi there,"" (to api@you.com)
    -   Example: ""Hi there,"" (to lostandfoundklia2@malaysiaairports.com.my)
    -   Example: ""Hi there,"" (to support+s6beta@strongapp.io)
-   **B. Tone & Language:** Tone is factual, concise, and focused on clearly stating the purpose of the email (reporting issues, requesting information/access). Can be firm when previous instructions were misunderstood or ignored.
    -   Example: ""I want to report a problem with Firecrawl Deep Research.""
    -   Example: ""Attached PDF:"" (followed by bullet points of content)
    -   Example: ""I recently bought an annual subscription for the Pro plan and I'd like to start testing out the API.""
    -   Example: ""Got it. I'll reach out to them."" (acknowledging previous information)
    -   Example: ""Seems to be fixed in the latest version.""
    -   Example: ""Works correctly now.""
    -   Example: ""Probably 60% of the time I want to edit a set’s weight, I edit the rest timer instead. Super annoying.""
-   **C. Structure & Formatting:** Uses bullet points or lists to enumerate details or provide requested information. Replies often directly address points raised by the recipient, sometimes using similar formatting.
    -   Example:
        ```
        Item details
        -2021 Apple 11-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi, 256GB) - Space Gray
        - With Black Magic Keyboard Case for 11-inch iPad Pro (2nd Generation) - US
        English
        Flight details
        AirAsia
        Flight D7 793
        ```
    -   Example (replying to numbered questions):
        ```
        1. Flight details (flight code/number):
        Flight D7 793
        Flight D7 792
        2. Estimate date and time occurred:
        Departed DPS - Fri, Apr 4, 2025, 5:40 PM
        Arrival DPS - Sunday, Apr 6, 2025, 8:25 PM
        ```
-   **D. Common Phrases or Idiosyncrasies:**
    -   States the purpose directly.
        -   Example: ""I want to report a problem with...""
        -   Example: ""I lost my iPad and would like to check if it was found at the airport.""
        -   Example: ""I recently bought an annual subscription... and I'd like to start testing out the API.""

            Date registered: Jul 10, 2016
            Workouts logged: 1136
            ```
-   **E. Communication Patterns The User Seems to Avoid:** Overly polite language, excessive apologies, unnecessary background information.
-   **F. Closing & Sign-off:** Uses ""Thanks!"" followed by ""—Chris"".
    -   Example: ""Thanks! —Chris""

### **Professional Network**

-   **A. Greetings & Openings:** Can be informal, especially with longer-standing contacts.
    -   Example: ""Hey Sofia!""
    -   Example: ""Hey Sofia!"" (in a later email)
    -   Example: ""Hey Adam,""
-   **B. Tone & Language:** Tone is generally friendly and conversational, transitioning into detailed discussion on specific topics (AI, venture, etc.).
    -   Example: ""Awesome jamming yesterday.""
    -   Example: ""It would be great to catch up!""
    -   Example: ""Lots of developments on our end, particularly automating some low-cognition tasks with increasingly-capable AI and looking at different models on the venture side.""
    -   Example: ""Would love to hear more about what you're seeing and how you're thinking about things going forward.""
    -   Example: ""I've been mostly playing with Windsurf and planning to try Lovable / Bolt soon. Pretty amazing the stuff you can do as a non-technical person at this point.""
-   **C. Structure & Formatting:** Uses paragraphs for narrative updates and can use bullet points or numbered lists for specific ideas or options. Links are embedded or listed directly.
    -   Example:
        ```
        As far as the community fund goes, I will write something up that's more
        detailed, but I think the simple version is we have a two choices. The
        first could be a stepping stone to the second, or just an alternative.
        1. *Supercharged syndicate / high-end SPV factory, optional Athena fund*
        - Clients share deals (via EA) w/ Athena network on *fixed,
        LP-friendly* terms
        - Athena itself may or may not invest through whatever means
        - Thesis is that a large, well-funded network
        - Key is getting costs of each deal to be very low
        2. *Dedicated community fund that invests in dealflow sourced by Athena
        clients / network*
        - External LPs pay standard-ish fees
        - Clients authorize EAs to find deals
        - We give originator client carry
        - Would consider doing as rolling fund
        - Works with or without SPVs
        ```
-   **D. Common Phrases or Idiosyncrasies:**
    -   Mentions mutual contacts or previous interactions.
        -   Example: ""Awesome jamming yesterday.""
        -   Example: ""I was just thinking about you, actually, because I was texting with Byron and Vittorio.""
        -   Example: ""I think I actually met Justin before I met you (also met him in PR, coincidentally).""
    -   Suggests ways to connect or follow up.
        -   Example: ""Happy to do via phone too if that's easier, just lmk what's best for you to move things forward.""
        -   Example: ""I'm around most afternoons Central Time... Let me know what works for you and we can set it up.""
        -   Example: ""You can text me or WhatsApp me anytime in the next 3 hours and I will pop up a Zoom.""
    -   Expresses enthusiasm for the topic.
        -   Example: ""Human Intelligence looks super interesting, and it's engaging in a problem space we've been exploring a lot at Athena and in my own personal AI projects.""
    -   Acknowledges limitations or potential issues.
        -   Example: ""I'm in Asia right now, so probably mornings to early afternoon your time works best if you're in London.""
-   **E. Communication Patterns The User Seems to Avoid:** Overly formal business jargon unless discussing specific industry concepts (e.g., SPVs, LPs).
-   **F. Closing & Sign-off:** Uses ""--Chris"" or ""—Chris"". Sometimes just ""—Chris"" after a conversational closing like ""Talk soon!"".
    -   Example: ""Talk soon! —Chris""
    -   Example: ""--Chris""

## **Initiating Threads vs. Replying**

-   **Initiating Threads:**
    -   Messages tend to be longer and more detailed, providing context, problem descriptions, or sharing project outputs. Structure often involves an opening statement of purpose, followed by bullet points or sections of details.
    -   Example (Issue Report):
        ```
        Hi there,
        I am writing to report a bug with Bolt.new that I encountered recently.
        Despite multiple attempts, the tool is not generating the app as requested.
        Here are the details:
        - *Issue with App Generation:* The tool consistently fails to generate
        the app I specified...
        ```
    -   Example (Sharing Project Output):
        ```
        Did some quick experiments with R1. These are first drafts (i.e. one shot
        prompts, no complex prompt chain with an editor in the loop or anything).
        The writing is really good—it's at times legitimately funny, coins clever
        neologisms, and crafts savvy metaphors with astute, surprising
        references.
        ---
        R1 Output 1
        https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXG0NbXbgM5NQThpN8DTL_CdUgJAFTEEl8M3HxnpZGw/edit?tab=t.0
        ```
    -   Example (Information Request):
        ```
        Hi,
        I recently bought an annual subscription for the Pro plan and I'd like to
        start testing out the API. Would you be able to give me access to all of
        the API endpoints? (Smart, Research, News, Search), and anything else that
        might be relevant to take full advantage of my purchase? Appreciate it!
        ```
-   **Replying:**
    -   Replies vary significantly in length and detail depending on the context and the nature of the previous message.
    -   **Brief Replies:** Used for simple acknowledgments, confirmations, or short answers. Often very concise, sometimes just a few words or a single sentence.
        -   Example: ""Thanks!"" (to vendor support)
        -   Example: ""Works correctly now."" (to vendor support)
        -   Example: ""Thank you"" (to vendor support)
        -   Example: ""Great. Just grabbed a time slot. Looking forward to it!"" (to professional contact)
        -   Example: ""100% agree"" (to internal peer)
    -   **Lengthy Replies:** Provided when responding to multiple questions, offering detailed feedback, sharing extensive information, or elaborating on previous points. These often mirror the structure of initiating emails with lists or distinct sections.
        -   Example (Responding to questions):
            ```
            1) The explanation is very clear. Do you have screenshots...
            2) Are they really trying to prioritize SMBs?
            I'm assuming their real focus is still larger companies,...
            3) Are they explicitly looking for AI-forward solutions...
            4) In terms of format, do you have a strong preference...
            ```
        -   Example (Providing detailed feedback/analysis): See the extensive reply in the ""Irrational labs Airtable Project"" thread (Message 4), which uses multiple sections and nested bullet points to structure the feedback on specific ""Key Behaviors.""

## **Handling Disagreements or Delivering Difficult News**

-   Confronts issues directly and factually. Clearly states the problem and provides evidence or reasoning. Can be highly critical when product functionality does not meet expectations or seems illogical.
    -   Example: ""I want to report a problem with Firecrawl Deep Research. It doesn't follow the JSON parameters we set.""
    -   Example: ""While not 100% sure if there is an error on our end or legitimate bug with API, we've checked everything on our end and found no reason we're the ones causing this issue.""
    -   Example: ""Despite multiple attempts, the tool is not generating the app as requested.""
    -   Example: ""I uploaded a fucking photo of a transaction as per the instructions, as it is a digital card."" (Note: This example is from the message body attributed to ""NA [not provided]"", not directly from Chris York, so it should not be included as his style based on the prompt's constraints. *Self-correction: Omit this example.*)
    -   Example: ""I did that already. Phone app also isn't working."" (when the system suggests a setup step was missed)
    -   Example (Critical feedback on product design/strategy): ""I think the idea of adding a column/field being a key behavior that is likely to have predictive value for the user upgrading is kind of insane.""
    -   Example: ""For importing data, this is actually the trickiest thing because it's very clear this is a much, much more powerful behavior than the other two, but it's also the area in which Airtable has executed the most shittily in terms of their actual product.""
    -   Example: ""Shoving someone in the app UI before they have seen the real product will only 1) cause confusion, 2) increase churn, and 3) reduce every other metric they claim to care about, since most of the actions related to those metrics are not even accessible there. Even in cases where you can actually do something in the app UI, the button is often in a different place (e.g. the share button is top right in the data UI vs bottom left the app UI).""

## **Providing Positive Feedback**

-   Acknowledges receipt of information or completion of tasks directly and briefly.
    -   Example: ""Thanks!"" (to Firecrawl support)
    -   Example: ""Works correctly now. Appreciate it!"" (to Firecrawl support)
    -   Example: ""Got it."" (to You.com support)
    -   Example: ""Seems to be fixed in the latest version."" (to Raycast support)
    -   Example: ""Yes, I just received the package. Thanks for following up!"" (to vendor)
-   Provides positive evaluation when sharing results or reviewing work, often mixed with constructive criticism or further ideas.
    -   Example: ""The writing is really good—it's at times legitimately funny, coins clever neologisms, and crafts savvy metaphors with astute, surprising references. We can probably find a lot of use cases for this."" (evaluating AI output)
    -   Example: ""Glad you like it! We're excited about the potential."" (acknowledging positive feedback from others)
    -   Example: ""I think it's a great idea."" (evaluating a proposal)

## **Providing Negative Feedback**

-   See also ""Handling Disagreements."" Delivers critical feedback directly, often focusing on functionality, design flaws, or strategic misalignment, supported by specific examples or reasoning. Language can be strong and opinionated.
    -   Example: ""Probably 60% of the time I want to edit a set’s weight, I edit the rest timer instead. Super annoying."" (to Strong App support)
    -   Example: ""Despite multiple attempts, the tool is not generating the app as requested."" (reporting bug)
    -   Example: ""The AI base creation UX is not quite there yet. It benefits from a little bit more design iteration before things happen. It's also extremely slow in comparison to just creating a base from a template, and it outputs way shittier example data. We probably create a better conversion in onboarding by getting people into a template that makes sense for them more quickly, rather than the risks associated with their poor AI implementation."" (on product feedback)
    -   Example: ""I would abandon app creation completely since you can get a ton of value out of Airtable without creating an app, and in fact, they reached either a $5 or $10 billion valuation before even apps were a feature, so it's probably not something we want to prioritize."" (on product strategy feedback)

## **Asking For Feedback/Advice**

-   Frames requests for input as seeking thoughts, feedback, or suggestions for improvement. Often poses specific questions, sometimes in a list format.
    -   Example: ""Things you may want to provide input on:"" (followed by a list of questions)
        -   Example: ""Time you want the email each day.""
        -   Example: ""We sorted by oldest tasks first--maybe you prefer newest tasks first.""
        -   Example: ""If you want us to omit things like tasks older than a certain age.""
    -   Example: ""Let us know your thoughts and Carlos can help customize it.""
    -   Example: ""Would you be able to give me access to all of the API endpoints? (Smart, Research, News, Search), and anything else that might be relevant to take full advantage of my purchase?"" (direct request to vendor)
    -   Example: ""Are there any plans to include Pro/Team users in API access soon?"" (follow-up question to vendor)
    -   Example: ""Could you please investigate these issues and let me know when a fix might be available?"" (to vendor support)
    -   Example: ""Do you think there's another option I'm missing, or should I just flesh out one or both of the above next?"" (to collaborator)
    -   Example: ""Let me know your thinking on what we've covered so far, and if there's a crawl-walk-run phasing to how we might do it..."" (to professional network)
    -   Example: ""If you have any questions about how to implement, let me know."" (offering help, implicitly inviting questions)
    -   Example: ""If you can share examples of the most viral or best-performing content so far from your work or related accounts, that would be helpful to help us orient the LLMs on extracting the best content and turning mundane quotes into useful final assets."" (requesting specific information to improve a process)

## **Asking For Favors**

-   Requests for assistance or access are direct and state the purpose. When asking for compensation or extra allowance due to issues, the request is clearly linked to the problems experienced.
    -   Example: ""Would you be able to give me access to all of the API endpoints?"" (requesting API access)
    -   Example: ""I would appreciate if you could also look into awarding extra tokens to compensate for the difficulties I’ve experienced."" (requesting compensation from vendor)
    -   Example: ""I lost my iPad and would like to check if it was found at the airport."" (requesting lost item check)","The user is a strategic operator and advisor working at the intersection of Behavioral Science, AI, and the Venture Capital/Tech ecosystem. Their role involves developing and applying AI/LLMs for product innovation, workflow automation, research, and prompt engineering. They are significantly involved in specific ventures, such as ""Athena"" (focused on AI and delegation, where they contribute to product feedback, onboarding processes, LLM-driven client context extraction, and strategic rebranding) and ""Powerset"" (likely a VC firm or tech company, where they are involved in engineering recruiting, open-source software analysis, investment tracking, and potentially portfolio support).\n\nThe user actively engages in market research, competitive analysis, and tech trend-spotting, particularly within the AI and startup landscape. They also focus on operational efficiency by developing and refining processes, such as onboarding procedures. A component of their work involves managing branding and marketing assets for their ventures. They collaborate with external partners (e.g., Irrational Labs) on behavioral science and AI projects and with internal stakeholders on strategic and operational initiatives.\n\n**Most Important or Valuable Projects Right Now:**\n*   **Athena:** This venture appears to be a primary focus, with recent and active work on AI-driven product features (e.g., Gmail query feedback), LLM-based client context extraction, onboarding process refinement, and a ""2025 Rebrand.""\n*   **Powerset Activities:** Significant operational and strategic involvement, including engineering recruiting, open-source software (OSS) enrichment and analysis, and tracking investments.\n*   **New AI Product/Feature Development:** Active ideation and development on new AI-related concepts, exemplified by ""Superchat V1 Ideas"" and ""Search Queries V1_o3 Feedback + Suggestions.""\n*   **Workflow Automation & Data Management Systems:** Foundational, starred systems like ""n8n Workflows - Synced"" and ""Airtable Bases & Tables"" indicate a reliance on robust automation and data organization.\n\n**Recurring Document Types (by purpose):**\n*   **Research & Analysis Spreadsheets/CSVs:** Used for market intelligence, company scouting, competitive analysis, data gathering for AI projects, and trend tracking.\n*   **Strategy & AI Feedback Documents:** For outlining new product ideas, providing detailed feedback on AI model performance or search queries, and defining technical/product strategies.\n*   **Project & Ideation Trackers (typically Spreadsheets):** To manage components of ongoing projects, brainstorm new features, and track development progress.\n*   **Operational SOPs & Process Artifacts:** Documents defining standard procedures for tasks like client onboarding, team processes, or delegation.\n*   **Datasets for Analysis or AI Input (often CSVs):** Exported or curated data used for specific analyses, feeding into other tools, or as input for AI models.\n\n**Solo vs. Collaborative Work:**\n*   **Solo Work:** A substantial portion of their work is performed independently, particularly in initial data collection, analysis, drafting documents, managing operational systems (e.g., `Powerset Eng Recruiting`, `Search Queries V1_o3 Feedback`), and creating branding assets.\n*   **Collaborative Work:** They collaborate on key strategic projects, such as the ""Client Context Extraction via LLMs Project | Athena"" (with 6 collaborators), ""Powerset Investments"" (with 2 collaborators, including Jonathan Swanson), and project-based work with external organizations like Irrational Labs (e.g., ""Bing Chat_Final Deliverable"" with 13 collaborators). They also consume and reference many documents shared by others in their network.\n\n**How and where specifically can an AI assistant help (non-obvious/creative uses):**\n*   **Behavioral Science-Enhanced Prompt Optimization:** An AI assistant could analyze and suggest improvements to prompts for LLMs (e.g., for `App System Prompts Research` or `Athena_Gmail_Query_Feedback`) by applying behavioral science principles (nudging, framing, reducing cognitive load) to enhance their effectiveness and user experience. It could also generate diverse prompt variations based on these principles for A/B testing.\n*   **Proactive ""Weak Signal"" Detection for VC/Market Trends:** Beyond basic news aggregation, an AI could monitor a wide array of unconventional sources (e.g., niche forums, academic pre-print servers, discussions in open-source communities related to `Powerset OSS Hub`) to identify early, ""weak signals"" of emerging technologies, talent movements, or market shifts relevant to their investment theses or product strategies. It could then synthesize these into concise, actionable insights.\n*   **Automated Generation of ""Pre-Mortem"" Scenarios for New Ventures:** For new ideas like ""Superchat V1 Ideas,"" an AI could generate a set of potential failure points or ""pre-mortem"" scenarios based on common startup pitfalls, behavioral biases in decision-making, and competitive landscapes, prompting deeper strategic thinking early on.\n*   **Cross-Pollination Catalyst for Projects:** Given their involvement in multiple ventures (Athena, Powerset, Superchat), an AI could analyze key documents (or summaries) from each project to identify non-obvious thematic overlaps, reusable technical components, or strategic insights that could be leveraged across different initiatives, fostering innovation and efficiency. For example, an approach used in `Powerset - GitHub Repo Filtering` might inspire a solution for `Client Context Extraction via LLMs Project | Athena`.\n*   **Intelligent Onboarding Content Personalization:** For `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`, an AI could help tailor onboarding materials or sequences for new clients/users by analyzing pre-provided client context (if available and permissioned), adapting the information and examples to be most relevant to their specific industry, role, or stated goals.\n\n**5 Most Important File Types (by purpose) with Recent Examples:**\n1.  **AI Model/Product Feedback & Specification Documents:** Documents detailing requirements, feedback, or performance analysis for AI-driven features or products.\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Search Queries V1_o3 Feedback + Suggestions`\n2.  **Market & Company Intelligence Aggregators (Spreadsheets/CSVs):** Central repositories for tracking startups, market trends, competitive data, or recruitment targets.\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Powerset Eng Recruiting`\n3.  **Workflow Automation & Data Management Blueprints (often represented by tracking spreadsheets):** Systems and databases (like those tracked in `n8n Workflows - Synced` or `Airtable Bases & Tables`) that are crucial for operational efficiency and data integrity.\n    *   *Recent Example:* `n8n Workflows - Synced` (as a proxy for the automated workflows it logs)\n4.  **New Venture/Product Ideation Hubs (Spreadsheets/Documents):** Files used for brainstorming, outlining, and planning new products, features, or strategic initiatives.\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Superchat V1 Ideas`\n5.  **Process & Operational Excellence Guides (Documents):** Documents establishing standard operating procedures, defining key processes, or outlining artifacts for client/team management.\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`\n\n**New, non-basic or non-obvious AI workflows most beneficial:**\n1.  **AI-Driven Behavioral Audit & Redesign Suggestions:**\n    *   **Workflow:** User provides product mockups, marketing copy, or user flow diagrams (e.g., from Athena's onboarding).\n    *   **AI Action:** An AI trained on a comprehensive library of behavioral science principles analyzes the materials for adherence to or violation of these principles (e.g., identifying choice overload, lack of clear feedback loops, missed opportunities for social proof).\n    *   **Output:** A report with specific, actionable recommendations on how to redesign elements to improve user engagement, decision-making, or task completion, citing the relevant behavioral principles. For instance, ""Consider reframing option X using the decoy effect to nudge users towards option Y,"" or ""The current sign-up process can be improved by incorporating the endowed progress effect.""\n2.  **Proactive ""Expert System"" for VC Due Diligence & Sourcing:**\n    *   **Workflow:** User defines key investment criteria (market, team attributes, tech stack, behavioral indicators of product-market fit, drawing from `Powerset` activities and research like `CRM Enrichment Platforms`).\n    *   **AI Action:** AI continuously scours diverse data sources (company databases, LinkedIn, GitHub, product reviews, news, patent filings). It not only identifies potential investment targets but also constructs a preliminary ""mini-thesis"" for each, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, unique differentiators (especially behavioral hooks), and potential risks, along with a confidence score. It could also identify individuals whose profiles match `Powerset Eng Recruiting` needs within these target companies.\n    *   **Output:** A prioritized feed of investment opportunities with synthesized initial due diligence, enabling the user to focus on the most promising leads and the ""why now"" faster.\n3.  **Dynamic SOP Co-pilot & Evolution Assistant:**\n    *   **Workflow:** User's SOPs (e.g., `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`, `Flight Preferences SOP`) are digitized and understood by an AI.\n    *   **AI Action:** As tasks are performed (potentially by delegated assistants, whose communications or task management updates could be monitored with permission), the AI acts as a co-pilot:\n        *   Provides context-aware snippets from the SOP.\n        *   Flags deviations from the SOP and asks for justification or suggests corrective action.\n        *   Logs common queries or pain points encountered during SOP execution.\n        *   Periodically suggests updates or clarifications to the SOP based on observed inefficiencies or successful ad-hoc solutions.\n    *   **Output:** Improved SOP adherence, reduced errors, continuous learning and refinement of operational processes, and less time spent on direct oversight.","# Chris York Network Context

---","This individual demonstrates a profound and consistent intellectual curiosity, focusing on understanding fundamental mechanisms, complex systems, and human cognition, alongside a strong drive for professional achievement and innovation.

Key Intellectual Pursuits & Interests:

1.  **Deep Cognitive Science & Neuroscience:** Exhibits a significant interest in the mechanics of human thought, perception, consciousness, decision-making, and motivation. This is evidenced by numerous, often academic, titles such as *Cognitive Gadgets* (Cecilia Heyes), *The Experience Machine* (Andy Clark), *On Task* (David Badre), *Projections* (Karl Deisseroth), *Playing with Reality* (Kelly Clancy), *The Molecule of More* (Lieberman & Long), *Determined* (Robert Sapolsky), and *Free Agents* (Kevin Mitchell). This suggests a desire to understand human behavior and mental processes at a fundamental level, beyond common pop psychology.

2.  **Systems Thinking & Complex Problem Solving:** Shows a strong preference for analyzing issues by examining underlying structures, interconnections, and root causes. This is highlighted by readings like *Upstream* (Dan Heath), *Thinking in Systems* (Donella Meadows), and notably, *In a Flight of Starlings* (Giorgio Parisi), which explores complex systems from a physics perspective. This indicates an approach to problem-solving that favors holistic understanding over superficial fixes.

3.  **Philosophy, Foundational Questions & Societal Analysis:** Engages with challenging works on free will, the nature of reality, human desire (*Wanting* by Luke Burgis), historical narratives (*The Dawn of Everything* by Graeber & Wengrow), cultural resilience (*Radical Hope* by Jonathan Lear), and societal dynamics (*The Authoritarians* by Bob Altemeyer, *The Status Game* by Will Storr). This points to a reflective mind keen on exploring profound questions about humanity and society.

4.  **Prediction, Probability & Data-Informed Decision-Making:** Consistently reads material focused on improving judgment under uncertainty, understanding statistical reasoning, and challenging cognitive biases (*On the Edge* by Nate Silver, *Everything Is Predictable* by Tom Chivers, *Don't Trust Your Gut* by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, *Mixed Signals* by Uri Gneezy). This suggests a value for evidence-based approaches.

Professional Focus & Approach:

*   **Entrepreneurship, Business Scaling & High Performance:** A significant cluster of books targets business growth, scaling strategies, and leadership in high-stakes environments (*Get Scalable*, *The E-Myth Revisited*, *The Power Law*, *Amp It Up*, *The Voltage Effect*, *The Cold Start Problem*, *Super Founders*). This is complemented by an interest in the psychology of high achievers (*Relentless*, *The Hypomanic Edge*).
*   **Strategic AI Integration:** Current reading like *Co-Intelligence* (Ethan Mollick) signals a proactive interest in understanding and leveraging artificial intelligence for collaboration and enhanced capabilities.
*   **Knowledge Synthesis & Communication:** Interest in structured knowledge work (*How to Take Smart Notes* by Sonke Ahrens) and the neuroscience of narrative (*Story Genius* by Lisa Cron, *Storyworthy* by Matthew Dicks) indicates a focus on effectively processing, retaining, and communicating information.

Inferred Thinking Style & Problem-Solving:

*   **Analytical & First-Principles Oriented:** Seeks to understand the 'why' behind phenomena, often delving into core principles rather than accepting surface-level explanations.
*   **Integrative & Interdisciplinary:** Likely connects insights from diverse fields (e.g., neuroscience, economics, philosophy, business) to form a comprehensive worldview and approach to problems.
*   **Forward-Looking & Adaptive:** Demonstrates an eagerness to engage with new ideas, emerging technologies (especially AI), and frameworks that challenge conventional wisdom.
*   **Values Rigor and Evidence:** Prefers data-backed insights and probabilistic thinking when making decisions or evaluating situations.

Recommendations for Engagement & Assistance:

*   **For the Chief of Staff:** 
    *   Present information and proposals with clear, logical reasoning, supported by evidence or first principles where possible.
    *   Frame problems and solutions in terms of systems, identifying root causes and potential second-order effects.
    *   Be prepared for discussions that connect operational details to broader strategic, philosophical, or scientific concepts.
    *   Proactively explore how data, emerging technologies (like AI), and insights from cognitive/behavioral sciences can be applied to achieve objectives.
    *   Support their efforts in knowledge organization, synthesis, and clear communication.

*   **For the AI Chat Application:**
    *   When queried, prioritize providing detailed, well-sourced information that explains underlying mechanisms and principles.
    *   Be capable of summarizing complex topics by breaking them down into fundamental components and relationships.
    *   Offer solutions or perspectives that consider systemic impacts and potential unintended consequences.
    *   Identify and highlight connections between concepts across their varied domains of interest.
    *   Assist with structuring information, generating summaries based on 'smart note' principles, and exploring 'what-if' scenarios based on probabilistic models or systems thinking.

## 1.  **Airline & Alliance Strategy:**
    *   Preferred Airlines: Air Canada is consistently used for major flight segments. Helijet is used for an initial segment from the likely home base. An Air Canada flight number (operated by Jazz) was used for the final return segment to the likely home base.
    *   Observed Airline Alliance Loyalties: Strong indication of preference for Star Alliance, as Air Canada is the primary carrier.
    *   Airlines Consistently Avoided: No data available from the provided record.

## 2.  **Fare Class & Cabin Policies:**
    *   Typical Fare Classes Booked: No data available on fare class or cabin (e.g., Economy, Business) from the provided record.
    *   Specific Heuristics or Conditions Observed for Upgrading: No data available.

## 3.  **Seating Accommodations:**
    *   General Seat Type (e.g., Aisle, Window): No data available.
    *   Specific Seat Location Preferences: No data available.
    *   Preferences Regarding Seat Pitch or Specific Seat Types: No data available.

## 4.  **Route & Itinerary Construction:**
    *   Commonly Flown Origin-Destination Pairs:
        *   The analyzed trip originates from Victoria (implied by Helijet use and final Air Canada/Jazz flight to Victoria) and travels to New York.
        *   Connecting Airports: Vancouver (YVR) and Montreal (YUL) were used as connection points.
    *   Preferred Airports if Multiple Serve a City:
        *   For New York: La Guardia Airport (LGA) was used. No data on preference over other NYC airports.
        *   For Vancouver: Vancouver International Airport (YVR) was used for connections.
        *   For Montreal: Montreal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL) is implied by ""Montreal"" city for connections.
        *   For Victoria: Departure likely via a location served by Helijet (e.g., Victoria Harbour); arrival into Victoria was to the city of Victoria (likely Victoria International Airport, YYJ, given the Air Canada/Jazz flight).
    *   Layover Tolerance:
        *   Standard Connections: Layovers of approximately 1 hour (Montreal outbound) to 1 hour 20 minutes (Montreal return) are acceptable.
        *   Short Connections: A very short connection of approximately 43 minutes at YVR (Air Canada to Air Canada/Jazz) was utilized on the return, indicating comfort with tight intra-airline transfers at this airport.
        *   Extended Connection Time at Originating Hub: On the outbound journey, an early morning Helijet departure (07:15) was followed by a late evening Air Canada departure from YVR (23:20). This suggests a willingness to arrive in Vancouver well in advance of the main flight, potentially for other activities or due to Helijet scheduling.
    *   Stance on Direct Flights vs. Connecting Flights: Connecting flights are utilized for transcontinental travel (e.g., Victoria to New York via YVR and YUL). There is no data to indicate a strict preference for direct flights over efficiently connected itineraries.

## 5.  **Scheduling & Timings:**
    *   Preferred Departure/Arrival Time Windows:
        *   Initial Departure (from Victoria area): Early morning (e.g., 07:15 Helijet departure).
        *   Transcontinental Eastbound Departure: Late evening (e.g., 23:20 from YVR), utilizing a red-eye flight.
        *   Arrival at East Coast Destination: Morning (e.g., 09:36 at LGA).
        *   Transcontinental Westbound Departure (from East Coast): Mid-morning (e.g., 10:30 from LGA).
        *   Final Arrival (to Victoria area): Late afternoon/early evening (e.g., after 16:30 arrival in Victoria).
    *   Day-of-Week Travel Patterns: The analyzed trip involved a Wednesday departure and a Saturday return. Insufficient data to establish a consistent day-of-week travel pattern.

## 6.  **Booking Channels & Payment:**
    *   Primary Booking Methods: No data available.
    *   Payment Preferences: No data available.

## 7.  **Cost Considerations & Price Ranges:**
    *   Observed Price Sensitivity: No data available.
    *   Any Implicit Rules for Balancing Cost vs. Convenience/Comfort: No data available.

## 8.  **Ancillary Services & Loyalty:**
    *   Preferences for In-Flight Wi-Fi, Specific Meal Requests: No data available.
    *   Baggage Requirements: No data available.
    *   Frequent Flyer Numbers/Loyalty Programs: Given the consistent use of Air Canada, ensure any applicable Air Canada (e.g., Aeroplan) or Star Alliance frequent flyer numbers are added to bookings.

## 9.  **Critical Mandates & Restrictions:**
    *   For travel originating from/returning to the Victoria area:
        *   Utilize Helijet for the initial segment to reach Vancouver/YVR.
        *   Utilize Air Canada (operated by Jazz in this instance) for the final segment from YVR to Victoria.
    *   Air Canada is the mandated carrier for primary flight segments within North America.

## 10. **Other Actionable Insights:**
    *   Group Travel: The recorded trip included multiple travelers (Robert, Jonathan, Chris). Future bookings may need to accommodate groups.
    *   Itinerary Structure to/from Victoria:
        *   Expect an initial leg via Helijet departing Victoria early morning.
        *   This may result in a significant period in Vancouver before a late evening transcontinental flight from YVR. Plan accordingly (e.g., هل client has activities in Vancouver, or prefers to wait at the airport, or if Helijet timing is the primary driver).
        *   Connections for East Coast travel are routed through Montreal (YUL) when flying Air Canada.
    *   Red-Eye Flights: Acceptable for eastbound overnight travel (e.g., YVR to Montreal).","current_location:

*   Internal collaboration is also substantial, focusing on leadership alignment, 1:1 management, and team-wide communications.

### 3. Work Patterns & Practices

*   **Deep Work Methodology:** Blocks out significant time for focused work or intensive team sessions. Examples: ""AI team brainstorm"" (6 hours), ""Leadership team planning"" (2 hours). Travel time on flights may also be used for focused work.
*   **Meeting Preparation Rituals:** Highly methodical. Consistently blocks 15-30 minutes before important external calls or interviews for ""Profile Review"" or reviewing CVs (e.g., ""Mateo Bryant's CV"", ""FYI ONLY: Profiles of today's meetings""). Ace Padua often assists in gathering this information.
*   **Decision-Making Forums:**
    *   **Daily Syncs (Jonathan/Robert/Haider):** For rapid alignment and operational decisions (15 min).
    *   **Athena Board Meetings:** Quarterly, for major strategic decisions and oversight (approx. 1.5-3 hours).
    *   **Leadership Team Planning Sessions:** Ad-hoc, for focused strategic work.
    *   **1:1s:** For individual progress, feedback, and decision-making with direct reports.
*   **Learning/Development Activities:** Actively seeks knowledge through webinars (""ChatGPT 102 Webinar""), industry outlooks (""Valor Equity Partners U.S. Tariffs Outlook""), and curated content (""Threads to review from Ruchir""). Attends/Leads internal masterclasses.
*   **Personal Productivity Systems:**
    *   **Delegation:** Leverages EAs (Ace Padua, MJ Tejedor) for scheduling, coordination, and travel logistics. Ace Padua also appears to handle some pre-meeting information gathering.
    *   **Time Blocking:** Explicitly blocks time for meeting preparation and focused work.
    *   **Tooling:** Heavy use of Zoom. Small Improvements for 1:1s. Colleagues use Superhuman (Jonathan might too). External parties use Calendly to book time with him.
    *   **Standardized Meeting Links:** Often uses recurring personal Zoom links for ad-hoc calls he organizes.
*   **Travel Patterns & Remote/In-Person Work Balance:**
    *   **Frequent Traveler:** Significant travel for strategic purposes, including Bay Area (multiple trips, e.g., May/June 2025), Manila (Pantheon 2025 in Jan 2025), Las Vegas (Q4 Planning in Oct 2024), Austin (Oct 2024), St. Barth's (personal, Feb 2025).
    *   **Remote Work:** Majority of day-to-day meetings are virtual (Zoom/phone). His calendar timezone (CET/CEST) and email about being ""East Coast now"" but traveling to Bay Area suggest he might be operating from Europe or East Coast US for significant periods, managing a global team and network.
    *   **In-Person Preference:** In-person meetings are prioritized for summits (KV Summit), board-related activities if possible, key relationship building (e.g., with VCs, networking), and team offsites/events (Manila Pantheon, Las Vegas planning).
    *   **Office Visits:** Occasional ""Travel to office"" and ""Visit Athena office"" (Palo Alto WeWork) entries indicate some time spent at a physical office when in the Bay Area.
*   **Strategic Thinking Time Allocation:** Allocates time through dedicated planning sessions (""Leadership team planning""), long brainstorms (""AI team brainstorm""), and attendance at strategic summits (""KV Summit""). Many VC discussions also involve strategic elements.

### 4. Temporal Intelligence

*   **Energy Management Patterns:**
    *   **Daily Rhythm (assuming US ET/PT for core team, Jonathan adjusting from Europe/ET):**
        *   Daily Leadership Syncs often occur around 17:00 CET/CEST (11:00 AM ET / 8:00 AM PT), suggesting a mid-morning check-in for the US-based team.
        *   External calls with US-based individuals are often scheduled in Jonathan's late afternoon/evening (CET/CEST), corresponding to their workday.
        *   Internal 1:1s (e.g., with Haider) also often occur in Jonathan's late afternoon.
    *   **Meeting Load:** Days can be densely packed with back-to-back meetings, especially when balancing internal leadership duties with external engagements and travel.
*   **Scheduling Preferences for Different Activity Types:**
    *   **1:1s:** Typically 30-60 minutes, recurring (e.g., weekly/bi-weekly with Haider).
    *   **Leadership Syncs:** Short and frequent (15 min daily).
    *   **External Calls (VCs, Partners, Candidates):** Usually 30-60 minutes. Prep time (15-30 min) is often scheduled immediately before.
    *   **Board Meetings:** Longer, 1.5-3 hours, scheduled quarterly.
    *   **Strategic/Deep Work Sessions:** Can be several hours long, scheduled ad-hoc or around specific events/needs.
*   **Protected Times and Boundaries:**
    *   **Personal Trips:** Clearly blocks time for personal events like ""Babymoon Surprise (Stay at Le Sereno)"" and related travel.
    *   **Family Integration:** ""Block | Q4 Planning with Families (Las Vegas)"" indicates blending work planning with family time.
    *   **Weekends:** Generally free of scheduled work meetings, though travel for Monday engagements or personal activities may occur.
    *   Other protected blocks are not explicitly visible but can be inferred from gaps, though his schedule appears quite full.
*   **Seasonal Workload Variations:**
    *   **Q4 (Oct-Dec):** Appears busy with planning (Las Vegas trip), investor relations, and leadership alignment. End-of-year activities.
    *   **Q1 (Jan-Mar):** Significant travel (Manila for Pantheon, St. Barth's), Board Meeting, continued VC engagement, daily syncs solidify.
    *   **Q2 (Apr-May):** Focus on Bay Area presence, KV Summit, continued investor catch-ups, potential ramp-up for mid-year objectives.
    *   Hiring pushes (like CTO search in mid-2024) create temporary intense periods.
*   **Response to High-Pressure Periods:**
    *   **Pre-Summit/Major Event:** Engages in intensive preparation, such as the ""AI team brainstorm"" before the KV Summit.
    *   **Pre-Board Meeting:** Schedule fills with preparation, internal alignment, and finalization of materials (inferred, not explicitly blocked as ""Board Prep"" but activity increases).
    *   Manages travel across time zones frequently, indicating an ability to adapt to demanding schedules.

### 5. Support Optimization Strategies for Assistants

Based on Jonathan's work patterns, an assistant can provide optimal support by:

1.  **Proactive Meeting Preparation:** Continue the practice of scheduling 15-30 minute prep slots before significant external meetings or interviews. Obtain and attach relevant profiles, CVs, or briefing notes to calendar events in advance (as seen with ""FYI ONLY: Profiles of today's meetings"").
2.  **Meticulous Travel & Logistics Management:** Given frequent domestic and international travel (often multi-leg and across time zones), manage all travel details (flights, accommodation, ground transport, visas if needed). Clearly note all confirmation numbers, addresses, and contact persons in calendar events. Double-check and communicate time zones for all travel and meetings.
3.  **Strategic Calendar Management:**
    *   Understand Jonathan's preferred times for different types of activities (e.g., deep work, external calls, internal 1:1s).
    *   Cluster similar meetings where possible to optimize focus and flow.
    *   Be a guardian of his time, ensuring prep time is respected and personal/protected blocks are maintained.
    *   Negotiate meeting times diligently, especially across multiple time zones, always clarifying which time zone is being referenced for all parties.
4.  **Briefing & Context Provision:** For key meetings, especially with new external contacts or VCs, prepare concise briefing notes including attendee backgrounds, company information, previous interactions, and desired outcomes, similar to the self-created ""Profile"" events.
5.  **Communication Facilitation:** Act as a primary point of contact for scheduling. Assist in tracking key follow-ups from important meetings if requested.
6.  **Information Management:** Ensure all meeting invitations have correct and functional meeting links (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.), locations, and attendee lists. Maintain an updated contact list of key collaborators.
7.  **Time Zone Vigilance:** Jonathan operates across multiple time zones (Europe, US East/West, Asia). All scheduling must be done with extreme care regarding time zones, clearly specifying them in invites and communications. Confirm his primary working time zone regularly, especially during extended travel.
8.  **Support for Recurring Rhythms:** Ensure recurring meetings like daily leadership syncs, 1:1s, and board meetings are consistently scheduled and any necessary materials or agendas are prepared/distributed in advance.
9.  **Anticipate Needs for In-Person Engagements:** When Jonathan is traveling for in-person meetings or summits, anticipate needs for local travel between meetings, printing materials, or quiet spaces for calls.

By understanding these patterns and preferences, an assistant can significantly enhance Jonathan Swanson's productivity and effectiveness.","# Client Hotel Preferences & Booking SOP

## Executive Summary

Jonathan Swanson's recent email communications paint a picture of a highly engaged, strategic leader deeply involved in the growth, technology, and investor relations of Athena, alongside managing personal ventures and network relationships. His primary focus areas are scaling Athena's core business, driving its AI product development (""human + machine assistant""), managing investor communications, and actively participating in executive hiring, particularly for key roles like CTO and CFO. He operates with a direct, concise communication style, often delegating execution to his team while retaining oversight and providing strategic input. He values personal connections, leveraging his network for introductions, feedback, and potential deals. Key operational patterns include a focus on data-driven insights (especially metrics like retention and supply constraints), a pragmatic approach to problem-solving (e.g., client issues, hiring challenges), and a clear bias towards action and rapid iteration, particularly in product development.

For a new Executive Assistant (EA), understanding the core priorities of Athena's growth (supply scaling, AI product launch, executive hiring) and Jonathan's key relationships (co-founder, leadership team, key investors) is paramount. The #1 priority should be managing incoming communications related to executive hiring and investor relations, quickly identifying action items or forwarding requests to the relevant internal teams (CTO, Head of Client Experience, Corporate Recruiting, Head EA), while keeping Jonathan informed with concise summaries. For AI support, focusing on drafting initial responses based on his direct and action-oriented style, and potentially summarizing key threads for quick consumption, would be highly valuable.

*   **Internal vs. External Focus:** Based on the volume of interactions in these threads, Jonathan interacts significantly with both internal Athena leadership (Robert, Chris, Haider, Kevin, Sol, Kandy) and a range of external investors and founders. The ratio appears roughly balanced, perhaps slightly leaning external in terms of the *number* of unique contacts, but with deep, recurring interactions with the internal leadership team. (Estimated 50% Internal / 50% External).

## 4. Work Methodology & Operational Patterns

*   **Problem-Solving & Decision-Making:**
    *   Jonathan is highly engaged in identifying problems and seeking solutions, often leveraging his team's expertise. He is comfortable making final decisions but values input from key leaders. He quickly delegates the task of solving the problem or gathering more information to the relevant team member.
    *   Example: When a client raised a significant security concern about providing laptops, Jonathan immediately delegated to his Head of Security: ""Looping Kevin. Client below reached out to me for help re laptop/security issue. Esteban has potential solutions. Can you get Esteban looped in? I’m sure there’s an existing client success thread going on this so don’t want to loop him myself bc I don’t know who is on that / any of the history…""
    *   Decisions are often communicated clearly and concisely via email after internal discussion: ""Got it! Ace, let's set it up default off pls."" (Regarding HubSpot email logging). When evaluating executive candidates, he provides direct feedback on strengths and weaknesses, often comparing them to internal talent or defining ideal profiles based on operational needs: ""My tldr is he seems like the right neighborhood for us but not strong enough.""
    *   He also uses questions to prompt team members to think critically or confirm understanding: ""Are we actually hiring interns? I assume not…""
*   **Information Processing & Management:**
    *   Jonathan prefers concise, summarized information, particularly for updates or data reviews. He expects his team to provide necessary context and links to source documents but doesn't want to wade through excessive detail initially.
    *   Example: Regarding investor metrics, he identifies discrepancies and asks for clarification and source data: ""Which is right? And who is the best person to double check all of these numbers you sent me Dale? We can't send investors incorrect numbers so I need someone to double check everything."" He explicitly requests a simplified source for future reporting: ""Pls create a master/source tab that includes a link to source data + explanation for each row of metrics.""
    *   He frequently forwards emails to loop in relevant team members or share information, often adding a brief directive or question: ""Use/ignore as you see fit"", ""Interest or pass?"".
    *   Follow-up on requests is consistent; he will chase responses if needed, particularly on critical items like candidate evaluations or client issues. ""Hmm I'll check. Will get back to you asap."" (When Anil Varanasi hadn't heard back).
*   **Productivity & Tools:**
    *   Jonathan uses email as a primary mode of communication and delegation. He references using Superhuman (""Sent via Superhuman"").
    *   He discusses or interacts with AI-related tools like OpenAI models (GPT-4, 4o mini, o3), Anthropic Claude (Opus 4.0), xAI Grok, Bolt, Cursor, Google Spreadsheet with Sheets GPT Extension, Scenario AI, Retro Diffusion, n8n, Fal.ai – Kling, Suno, Pixabay, SQL & Supabase.
    *   He is interested in leveraging AI for core business functions (task management, data analysis, content creation) and for enhancing the abilities of human assistants (""AI co-pilot"", ""human-AI agents""). He sees Athena's data set as a unique asset for training AI agents. ""Athena is incredibly well poised to both ride this wave + we have the data set that all these companies are going to need to make these models really work.""
*   **Professional Persona:**
    *   Jonathan's demeanor is generally direct and results-oriented. He is often informal and friendly with colleagues and close network contacts (""Yo dude"", ""Hey bud"", ""KK""), but maintains a professional tone with external partners and investors.
    *   He is enthusiastic about Athena's progress (""Q2 was a blockbuster quarter"", ""Business continues to rip"") and the potential of AI (""SUPER PUMPED about it"", ""Wild times!"").
    *   He is appreciative of his team's work (""Ann, this is freaking incredible! Wow wow wow."") and network's support (""Thank you for all your support, guidance, advocacy, and cheerleading these last few years — you've been a dream client and supporter!"").
    *   He has a strong conviction in Athena's vision and strategy, particularly the human+AI model and the value of their data set.
    *   He appears to value discretion and confidentiality, explicitly mentioning it for investor updates and internal discussions about sensitive topics (CTO hiring, confidential SF trip). ""As always, everything below is confidential / no forwarding.""

## 5. Actionable Recommendations for Support Optimization

*   **EA Onboarding & Day-to-Day Focus:**
    *   **#1 Priority:** Triage and manage communications related to **Executive Hiring** and **Investor Relations**. Jonathan receives many introductions and updates related to these critical areas. The EA should quickly identify if an email is related to an active hiring process (CFO, Product, Growth, etc.) or from a key investor, summarize the core request/information, determine the relevant internal party (e.g., Sol for CoS/EA candidates, Head of Recruiting for execs, Haider for tech candidates, Kevin for client experience roles, Robert for final stage execs/strategy), and draft a brief response for Jonathan acknowledging receipt and indicating internal follow-up.
    *   **Priority 2:** Manage **Scheduling Requests**, particularly those from key external contacts (investors, founders) and internal leadership team members. Jonathan travels frequently and his calendar requires careful coordination across time zones and locations (Mill Valley, SF, LA, Chamonix, PR). Ace already handles much of this, and the EA should work closely with her to manage Jonathan's complex schedule and location changes.
    *   **Priority 3:** Filter and route **AI Tool/Product Pitches**. Jonathan receives introductions to new AI startups and tools. The EA should identify these, forward them to the relevant internal team members for evaluation (Haider, Vasu, Chris York, Carlos, Eliot), and log them in a tracking system if one exists (or create a simple one).
    *   **Priority 4:** Triage and escalate **Sensitive Client Issues/Feedback**. When a client or contact bypasses standard support channels to reach Jonathan directly with a significant problem (buyout requests, major complaints), the EA should quickly identify the severity, forward to the relevant executive (Kevin Rath, Kandy White), and flag it for Jonathan's immediate attention.
    *   **Priority 5:** Manage **Requests for Information/Documents**. Jonathan is often asked for documents like investor updates or company information. The EA should maintain access to these standard documents and be able to quickly provide them or delegate the request to the appropriate person (e.g., Dale for financial metrics, Haider/Jon for tech hiring updates).
*   **Emails/Tasks for EA/AI Support:**
    *   Draft initial acknowledgments for introductions or inbound inquiries based on Jonathan's style (e.g., ""Thanks [introducer name] (bcc) and great to meet you [new contact name]."").
    *   Draft decline emails for opportunities Jonathan is passing on, using concise language like ""No thank you. Good luck."" or referencing bandwidth constraints (""heads down building"").
    *   Summarize long email threads (like the Metric buyout issue or the Tracy Chou feedback) before Jonathan reads them, highlighting the core issue, key players, and proposed next steps.
    *   Configure AI to flag emails from key collaborators and potential investors/candidates.
    *   AI could potentially draft basic scheduling emails based on provided availability.
*   **Preferred Methods for Task Delegation/Updates:**
    *   Jonathan frequently delegates tasks or information sharing by forwarding emails with brief, direct instructions in the body (""Looping X who can help"", ""FYI"", ""Can you pls...?"").
    *   He uses inline responses to answer specific questions within a forwarded email, indicating he prefers responses within the original context when possible.
    *   He uses text/Whatsapp for urgent or quick follow-ups (""just whatsapp/text me anytime next week"", ""Lmk if I should follow up""). For non-urgent items, email is sufficient.
*   **Proactive Support Opportunities:**
    *   Maintain an up-to-date list of key company metrics, investor updates, and standard documents to quickly fulfill requests without interrupting Jonathan or other executives.
    *   Create a tracking system for executive candidate pipeline status based on emails, anticipating when follow-ups are needed or when candidates are nearing decision points.
    *   Pre-draft standard responses for common types of emails (e.g., investor intros when not fundraising, responses to AI tool pitches with relevant team contacts).
    *   Monitor key threads for stalled conversations or missed follow-ups (e.g., Beth not following up with Meter client) and gently prompt the responsible party or inform Jonathan if necessary.
    *   Summarize relevant news articles or market trend analyses (like Stratechery updates or reports on AI trends) and highlight sections most relevant to Athena's strategy or AI vision for Jonathan's quick consumption.","# **Email Style Writing Guide for Jonathan Swanson (jonathan@athena.com)**

## Initiating Threads vs. Replying

*   **Initiating Threads:**
    *   Often starts with a clear purpose or introduction: ""Hi Andrew, just saw you are CEO of Elroy Air. Congrats!"" (congrats/catch up) ""Hi Pam, I'd love to get your thoughts on the product we're building at Athena."" (request for meeting/feedback) ""Yo dude, a woman in my neighborhood runs some sort of 'how to start your business' lecture series..."" (pitching a partnership idea) ""Kevin R leads client experience for Athena. Kevin L is ceo of super cool company Harbor."" (introducing two people and stating context) ""Hi Rob + James, You've probably seen the Anthropic computer use model, and now this coming from Google:"" (sharing observations/strategy) ""Hi Eric, my co-founder forwarded me your email."" (responding to an intro, but initiating the main conversation thread)
    *   Includes necessary context upfront.
    *   Can be conversational or more formal depending on the recipient.
*   **Replying:**
    *   Replies are generally much briefer than initial messages.
    *   Replies quickly to confirm receipt or provide a short answer: ""Okay"", ""Thanks"", ""Will do"", ""Got it"", ""Perfect"", ""On it"", ""Haha"", ""Lol love it"".
    *   Replies are lengthy when responding to detailed questions or providing nuanced feedback (e.g., the discussion with Scott Sullinger/Liz Karr on CFO candidates, the discussion with Dale Leuterio on metrics discrepancies, the discussion with Jen Jones on project results, the discussion with Haider Sabri/Vasu Sharma on AI data collection).
    *   Replies inline frequently when responding to specific points within a longer email.

## Handling Disagreements or Delivering Difficult News

*   Directly states the difficult news or disagreement, often with a brief explanation. Acknowledges the other person's perspective or situation first. Aims to maintain a positive relationship where possible, even when saying no.
    *   ""Hi Anil, sorry you've lost a couple key team members. I know that's always frustrating. As much as we'd love to, we can't just let clients hire ex-Athena team members bc it breaks our model. That's why we have the hefty buy out fee; not because we think that is the right number but because any buyout at all undermines our model.""
    *   ""Hi Nick, my co-founder forwarded me your email. We're heads down building so not talking to investors now but your email wins for the most thoughtful outreach we've gotten this month. :)"" (Soft no to meeting *now*, but compliments the outreach).
    *   ""No thank you. Good luck"" (Very brief, clear no to an LP investment ask).
    *   ""We are passing on Jen. Not impressed by projects."" (Direct feedback on a candidate).
    *   ""My tldr is he seems like the right neighborhood for us but not strong enough."" (Feedback on a candidate).
    *   ""Hi Madhvi, I synced with Robert yesterday and he wants us to focus on CFOs with larger operational experience... So we'll politely pass for now but I'd love to be helpful as you search."" (Polite no to a candidate, offers alternative help).

## Providing Positive Feedback

*   Uses positive adjectives and exclamation points. Direct and enthusiastic. Often refers to specific accomplishments.
    *   ""Congrats! How freaking cool, and so happy for you."" (To Andrew Clare on his new role).
    *   ""Awesome, excited to get you leverage Josh!"" (To a new client).
    *   ""Nice email :)"" (To Robert Hayes on a job offer).
    *   ""Fantastic client for us. Thank you!"" (To JCal for a referral).
    *   ""Awesome update Jonathan. The supply side constraint is frustrating but keeping the bar high for quality obviously yields downstream benefits..."" (Quoted from Walter Kortschak, but Jonathan responds positively to feedback).
    *   ""Increeeeeeedible execution."" (Quoted from Eric Jorgenson, but Jonathan responds positively to feedback).
    *   ""Ann, this is freaking incredible! Wow wow wow."" (To Ann Javellana on her project).
    *   ""This is great. Thank you."" (To Jen Jones on project update).
    *   ""Holy shit congrats! That is an epic VIP client for us. Well done :)"" (To Kandy White on a sales prospect).
    *   ""Awesome updates, will share with candidates and internally to boost morale."" (Quoted from Haider Sabri, but Jonathan responds positively to his update).
    *   ""You are blazing a new frontier for all XPs at Athena."" (To Ann Javellana).

## Providing Negative Feedback

*   Direct and specific about what isn't working or is problematic. Can be blunt. Often frames it as a need for improvement or misalignment.
    *   ""Spaces the meeting spot will be pretty drab. We should find a more inspiring location for the conversation — more inspiring spaces are better for closing candidates."" (Feedback on meeting location).
    *   ""I think it's a dumb place to build (feature not company)"" (Feedback on a startup idea).
    *   ""My hesitancy is I have no idea what this is used for — how exactly does my connecting my inbox help?"" (Questioning a proposed process).
    *   ""You should give Dee feedback on formatting of message. Kinda weird 'hello' then line break…"" (Feedback on email format).
    *   ""I was going into this strongly biased towards trialing her but now based on the reference I'm biased against."" (Feedback on a candidate after reference).
    *   ""Strong pass."" (Direct decision on a candidate).
    *   ""Not impressed by projects."" (Feedback on candidate's work).
    *   ""her resume leans nonprofit, but in conversation, she was clear: she is ready to pivot... I'm skeptical based on her resume."" (Skepticism about candidate fit).
    *   ""Carole was a no show (waited 8 minutes just now). If she has a good excuse happy to reschedule for next week."" (Reporting a candidate no-show).

## Asking For Feedback/Advice

*   Clearly states the topic for which feedback is requested. Asks open-ended questions. Requests input from relevant parties (e.g., CTO on tech, investors on business/recruiting).
    *   ""Anything you can share re your release plans for year ahead that'd be helpful for me to know about? Just high level / whatever you can share…"" (Asking for product roadmap info from a network contact).
    *   ""Lots of speculation about what GPT4 will look like. Do you think your upcoming models will broadly keep pace with OpenAI’s or hard to say until you see it in the wild? Reason I ask is OpenAI is asking us for a big commitment..."" (Asking for competitive analysis advice from a network contact).
    *   ""Any reaction?"" (Asking for opinion on a startup idea from a network contact).
    *   ""How long until you have something we can try?"" (Asking a startup founder about their product timeline).

    *   ""How's the SEO work coming along from your perspective?"" (Asking a vendor for update/feedback).
    *   ""What's our strategy with evaluating/sharing tools like this with our assistants?"" (Asking an internal team member for strategic input).
    *   ""Just curious if we have a plan/team in place to do this or if it's more ad hoc today."" (Asking an internal team member about current process).
    *   ""What are the parameters of your dream job?"" (Asking a candidate he passed on about their search criteria to potentially help).

## Asking For Favors

*   Directly states the request. Often prefaces the request by acknowledging it's a favor or optional (""ZERO pressure but""). Explains the reason for the request.
    *   ""Any chance we could move this to next Friday June 13th at Pebblebed offices?"" (Asking to reschedule a meeting).
    *   ""If it would help salve the wound with this founder, I’d be happy to support him finding a new assistant (not with Athena)."" (Offering a favor).
    *   ""Do you have a partnership lead that would like to explore this?"" (Asking an internal peer to handle a lead).
    *   ""If not I can ask their CBO."" (Offering to pull a favor for the team).
    *   ""Should I try to recruit or no?"" (Asking internal team for direction on a recruitment lead).
    *   ""Should I just email him or is it best if you tee it up?"" (Asking for preference on an introduction).

(Requesting action from his EA).","The user is a senior executive at Athena, focusing on strategic leadership, financial management, investor relations, and people operations. Their work involves shaping the company's direction, securing funding, overseeing financial health, and building a high-performing team.

**Most Important or Valuable Projects Right Now:**
*   **Investor Relations and Fundraising (May-June 2025 Focus):** A significant current priority involves preparing and disseminating investor updates and communications. This includes tailoring presentations and documents for specific stakeholders (e.g., ""Investors Update May 2025 (copy for Mark)"", ""Quarterly Investor Updates (copy for Mark)""), responding to investor inquiries (""Response to Mark (draft June 2025)""), and collaborating on core investor materials (""Investors Update May 2025"").
*   **Strategic Growth Initiatives & Financial Forecasting:** Ongoing involvement in refining the company's growth model (""MASTER_Growth Model v4.2"") and reviewing departmental performance (e.g., ""Q1 2025 Revenue Team - QBR"") indicates a focus on strategic planning and execution.
*   **Exploring Strategic Partnerships/M&A:** Actively working on documents like ""Athena selling to an AI Lab"" suggests exploration of significant new business opportunities or strategic alliances.
*   **Key Product/Service Development:** Involvement in proposals like ""Matching 2.0 Proposal & Test Plan"" points to oversight of major internal development projects.

**Recurring Document Types (by purpose):**
*   **Investor Communications:** Presentations and documents for investor updates, fundraising, and board reporting (e.g., investor decks, quarterly updates).
*   **Financial & Valuation Documents:** Financial models, forecasts, valuation reports (e.g., 409A valuations, growth models, budget vs. actuals).
*   **Strategic Plans & Proposals:** Documents outlining new initiatives, market strategies, or significant internal projects.
*   **Internal Review & Leadership Materials:** Presentations for quarterly business reviews (QBRs), leadership roundtables, and internal strategic discussions.
*   **People Operations Documents:** Playbooks for onboarding and training, performance scorecards, hiring trackers, and employee engagement analyses.
*   **Legal & Operational Agreements:** Service agreements, data processing addendums, and other contractual documents.

**Work Alone vs. With Collaborators:**
*   **Solo/Small Group Work (for refinement & personalization):** The user often takes core, collaboratively developed materials and refines or personalizes them for specific audiences, particularly for external communications like investor updates. This might involve working with one other internal colleague for review (e.g., ""Response to Mark"" with Robert Hayes; ""Investor Update copies for Mark"" with an external commenter).
*   **Collaborative Work (for core strategy & operations):** The user is heavily involved as a collaborator (typically as a 'writer' or key stakeholder) in the development of critical company documents. This includes:
    *   Core investor presentations (""Investors Update May 2025"" - 11 collaborators).
    *   Strategic financial models (""MASTER_Growth Model v4.2"" - 24 collaborators).
    *   Departmental reviews (""Q1 2025 Revenue Team - QBR"" - 25 collaborators).
    *   Valuation processes (""Athena Group 409A Results"" - 14 collaborators).
    *   Strategic explorations (""Athena selling to an AI Lab"" - 4 collaborators including external parties).

**How and Where Specifically can an AI Assistant Help:**
1.  **Investor Interaction Intelligence & Preparation:**
    *   AI could analyze past investor communications (Q&As, emails if accessible), current investor sentiment (from public data), and the content of draft investor updates to predict likely questions, concerns, and areas of deep-dive for upcoming investor meetings.
    *   Generate tailored talking points and preemptive answers, keyed to specific investor profiles or past interactions, ensuring the user is exceptionally well-prepared.
2.  **Strategic Scenario & Risk Modeling for New Ventures:**
    *   For initiatives like ""Athena selling to an AI Lab"" or ""Matching 2.0 Proposal,"" AI can model various strategic scenarios (e.g., partnership structures, competitive responses, market adoption curves).
    *   Perform automated ""red teaming"" by identifying potential blind spots, unstated assumptions, and downside risks in proposals, prompting deeper strategic thinking.
3.  **Dynamic Board & Leadership Briefing Automation:**
    *   AI can synthesize information from key documents like ""MASTER_Growth Model,"" QBR decks, and financial reports to generate a dynamic, real-time dashboard or pre-read summary for board/leadership meetings.
    *   Highlight key metric changes, progress against goals, emerging risks, and cross-departmental implications, allowing the user to focus on strategic discussion rather than data compilation.
4.  **Proactive People Operations Insights:**
    *   Analyze trends from ""Scorecard"" data, ""Q1 Engagement Survey Action Items,"" and onboarding playbooks to identify patterns in employee performance, engagement drivers/detractors, or onboarding effectiveness.
    *   Suggest data-driven interventions for leadership development, identify high-potential individuals, or flag areas where internal processes/training need refinement.
5.  **Intelligent Document Synthesis for Complex Agreements & Negotiations:**
    *   When preparing for or reviewing complex agreements (e.g., ""Athena x Nyakati_Service Agreement,"" potential M&A documents), AI can cross-reference terms against industry benchmarks, past company agreements, or regulatory requirements.
    *   Identify non-standard clauses, potential negotiation sticking points, or areas of ambiguity, providing the user with a pre-negotiation advantage or a more thorough review.

**5 Most Important File Types (by purpose) & Recent Examples:**
1.  **Investor Update Decks/Documents:** Central to funding and stakeholder management.
    *   Example: ""Investors Update May 2025"" (collaborative version or user's tailored copy).
2.  **Strategic Financial Models & Forecasts:** Drive planning and decision-making.
    *   Example: ""MASTER_Growth Model v4.2"".
3.  **High-Stakes Strategic Proposals:** Define critical new directions or ventures.
    *   Example: ""Athena selling to an AI Lab"".
4.  **Company Valuation Reports:** Key for equity, fundraising, and compliance.
    *   Example: ""Athena Group 409A Results"".
5.  **Internal Strategic & Performance Review Decks:** Facilitate oversight and alignment (e.g., Board Decks, QBRs, Leadership Meeting materials).
    *   Example: ""Q1 2025 Revenue Team - QBR"".

**New, Non-Basic or Non-Obvious AI Workflows:**
1.  **AI-Powered Investor Persona & Engagement Strategist:**
    *   **Process:** AI analyzes an investor's past investments, public statements, firm's thesis, and historical interactions with Athena. It then creates a detailed ""investor persona,"" including likely priorities, risk tolerance, and communication style preferences.
    *   **Benefit:** Before any interaction, AI suggests the optimal narrative angle, key metrics to emphasize, and even the tone for communications, helping the user tailor their approach for maximum impact with each specific investor or group. This goes beyond predicting questions to shaping the entire engagement strategy.
2.  **""Growth Hypothesis"" Validation & Iteration Engine:**
    *   **Process:** The user inputs a strategic growth hypothesis (e.g., related to ""Matching 2.0"" or ""Athena selling to an AI Lab""). AI scours market data, competitor actions, economic indicators, and internal performance data (""MASTER_Growth Model v4.2"") to find supporting or contradictory evidence. It can then suggest refinements to the hypothesis or experiments to test its validity.
    *   **Benefit:** Provides a rapid, data-driven feedback loop for strategic thinking, allowing for quicker validation or pivoting of key growth initiatives before significant resources are committed.
3.  **Proactive Executive Talent Pipeline & Succession Planner:**
    *   **Process:** AI analyzes data from performance reviews (""Scorecards""), leadership development program feedback (""Leadership Roundtable2025""), and hiring trackers (""Candidate Onsite Tracker""). It identifies individuals demonstrating key leadership competencies, tracks their development velocity, and flags potential succession gaps for critical roles based on the company's strategic roadmap.
    *   **Benefit:** Enables more strategic and proactive talent management by identifying and nurturing future leaders, and highlighting potential leadership risks before they become critical, directly supporting the user's ""executive and team hiring"" and ""leadership development"" responsibilities.","# Jonathan Swanson Network Context
