# Roadmap

---

## New Features 

### Near-Term
- Rename chat titles, if necessary, after every 2 messages
- In artifact view, move chat to the right like Cursor and still show sidebar on left
- Auto-select tools/MCPs based on user job title
- AI suggested prompts should be personalized based on user context & recent actions in third-party services (email, meetings, etc)
- Better system prompt (e.g. https://github.com/elder-plinius/CL4R1T4S/blob/main/OPENAI/ChatGPT/ChatGPT-04-16-2025)
- More compact UI
- More personality in system prompt (maybe the AI is a hater?)
- Fix AI suggestions and make personalized based on user data in database (components/suggested-actions.tsx and tests/prompts/basic.ts)
- Implement automated testing with Jest etc
- Add image handling in n8n webhook workflow
- Add other file handling in n8n webhook workflow and file input validation for n8n model
- Switch auth to Clerk
- [x] Run n8n workflow in background on sign-up to personalize experience (e.g. save files of research to Supabase for user, create personalization to inject into prompt context window for interactions, etc)
- [ ] Move model selector to bottom of screen above chat input textarea


### Long-Term
- Create templates for artifacts, like PRD, job description, etc; flag which ones are relevant based on user job title
- Enable artifact creation in external services like Google Docs & Google Sheets
- AI can send you messages when you're not on the website and these are marked as new with a dot like iMessage
- Streaming interruption (https://upstash.com/blog/resumable-llm-streams)
- Implement more complex memory solution like Zep or custom one
- Deep research tool
- Tool selection UI
- Use TanStack table for spreadsheet artifact (maybe)
- MacOS app
- More model selection options
- Automatic prompt correction and/or step-by-step elicitation for complex prompts
- [ ] Use TipTap for artifact editor

## Enhancements to Current Features

### Low Effort
- Improve prompt for chat title generation in app/(chat)/actions.ts - generateTitleFromUserMessage
- Have Google refresh token saved to correct user table on user sign up (currently saved to a separate, duplicate, otherwise-unused table)

### High Effort
- Double-clicking a chat title should allow you to edit the chat title and it should be saved instantly in the UI and to Supabase in bg
